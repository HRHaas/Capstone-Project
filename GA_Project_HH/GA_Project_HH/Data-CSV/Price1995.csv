"This  chapter  provides  background  information  on  the electric   power   industry   in   the   United   States   and explains   consumer   sectors   and   sales,   revenue,   and average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  those  sectors.  It also  provides  some  information  on  the  current  issues taking  place  in  the  electric  power  industry  that  may affect    retail    sales    and    revenue.    Additionally,    a summary   of   the  statistics   for   1995   on   retail   sales, revenue,  and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  pre- sented.
Background
Electric  power  is  an  integral  part  of  life  in  the  United States.   It   is   indispensable   to   factories,   commercial establishments,   homes,   and   even   most   recreational facilities.   Lack   of   electric   power   causes   not   only inconvenience,  but  also  economic  loss  due  to  reduced industrial  production.  Electric  utilities  are  responsible for  ensuring  an  adequate  and  reliable  source  of  elec- tricity  to  all  consumers  in  their  service  territories  at  a reasonable cost.
Electric   utilities   are   regulated   by   local,   State,   and Federal   authorities.   Generally,   interstate   activities (those  that  cross  State  lines)  are  subject  to  Federal regulation,  while  intrastate  activities  are  subject  to State  regulation.  Wholesale  rates  (sales  and  purchases between  electric  utilities),  licensing  of  hydroelectric facilities,  questions  of  nuclear  safety  and  high-level nuclear  waste  disposal,  and  environmental  regulation are  Federal  concerns.  Approval  for  most  plant  and transmission  line  construction  and  retail  rate  levels are State regulatory functions.
State   public   service   commissions   have   jurisdiction primarily   over   the   generally   large,   vertically   inte- grated, investor-owned electric utilities that own more than  75  percent  of  the  Nation's  generating  and  trans- mission  capacity  and  serve  about  75  percent  of  ulti- mate    consumers.    There    are    approximately    250 investor-owned    electric    utilities,    2,000    publicly owned   electric   utilities,   950   consumer-owned   rural electric  cooperatives,  and  10  Federal  electric  utilities. Approximately  20  States  regulate  cooperatives,  and  7 States regulate municipal electric utilities; many State legislatures,   however,   defer   this   control   to   local municipal officials or cooperative members.
Consumer  Sectors.    Utility   service   territories   are geographically  distinct  from  one  another.  Each  terri- tory  is  usually  composed  of  many  different  types  of consumers.   Electricity   consumers   are   divided   into
classes  of  service  or  sectors  (residential,  commercial,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"industrial, and other) based on the type of service they receive.
Sectorial  classification  of  consumers  is  determined  by each  utility  and  is  based  on  various  criteria  such  as demand   levels,   rate   schedules,   Standard   Industrial Classification    (SIC)    codes,    distribution    voltage, accounting  methods,  end-use  applications,  and  other social  and  economic  characteristics.  Electric  utilities use  consumer  classifications  for  planning  (e.g.,  load growth  and  peak  demand)  and  for  determining  their sales  and  revenue  requirements  (costs  of  service)  in order to derive their rates. Utilities typically employ a number   of   rate   schedules   for   a   single   sector.   The alternative  rate  schedules  reflect  consumers'  varying consumption  levels  and  patterns  and  the  associated impact  on  the  utility's  costs  of  providing  electrical service.
Reclassification   of   consumers,   usually   between   the commercial  and  industrial  sectors,  may  occur  from year  to  year  due  to  changes  in  demand  level,  eco- nomic  factors,  or  other  factors.  For  this  reason,  the commercial  and  industrial  sectors  are  discussed  col- lectively  as  the  nonresidential  sector  in  some  sections of this publication.
The residential sector includes private households and apartment buildings where energy is consumed prima- rily for space heating, water heating, air conditioning, lighting,  refrigeration,  cooking,  and  clothes  drying. The   commercial   sector   includes   nonmanufacturing business establishments such as hotels, motels, restau- rants,  wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health, social,   and   educational   institutions.   Sometimes   the commercial sector includes small manufacturing facil- ities  as  well.  The  industrial  sector  includes  manufac- turing,  construction,  mining,  agriculture,  fishing,  and forestry establishments (SIC codes 1 through 39).
An electric utility may classify commercial and indus- trial  consumers  based  on  either  SIC  codes  or  demand and/or usage falling within specified limits. The limits are  set  by  the  electric  utility  based  on  different  rate schedules.  The  ""other""  sector  includes  public  street and  highway  lighting,  railroads  and  railways,  munici- palities,  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal Governments  under  special  contracts  or  agreements, and  other  utility  departments,  as  defined  by  the  perti- nent regulatory agency and/or electric utility.
Revenue.   The  revenue  associated  with  sales  to  ulti- mate  consumers  is  the  operating  revenue  reported  by the    utility.    Operating    revenue    includes    energy charges,  demand  charges,  consumer  service  charges, environmental  surcharges,  fuel  adjustments,  and  other
miscellaneous charges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Among    other    costs    of    service,    utility    operating revenues    include    State    and    local    taxes,    Federal income taxes, and other taxes paid by the utility. State and  local  authorities  tax  the  value  of  plants  (property taxes),  the  amount  of  revenues  (gross  receipts  taxes), purchases   of   materials   and   services   (sales   and   use taxes),  and  a  potentially  long  list  of  other  items  that vary extensively by taxing authority. Federal taxes are for the most part ""payroll"" taxes. Taxes deducted from employees'   pay,   such   as   Federal   income   taxes   and employees'  share  of  Social  Security  taxes  are  not  a part  of  the  utility's  ""tax  costs,""  but  are  paid  to  the taxing   authorities   in   the   name   of   the   employees. These  taxes  are  included  in  the  electric  utility's  costs of    service    (i.e.,    revenue    requirements)    and    are included  in  the  amounts  recovered  from  consumers  in rates and reported in operating revenues.
Electric  utilities,  like  other  business  enterprises,  are required  by  various  taxing  authorities  to  collect  and remit   taxes   assessed   on   their   consumers.   In   this regard,  the  utility  serves  as  an  agent  for  the  taxing authority.  Taxes  assessed  on  consumers,  such  as  a gross   receipts   tax   or   sales   tax,   are   called   ""pass through""  taxes.  These  taxes  do  not  represent  a  cost  to the   utility   and   are   not   recorded   in   the   operating revenues  of  the  utility.  However,  taxing  authorities differ  on  whether  a  specific  tax  is  assessed  to  the utility  or  to  the  consumer,  a  difference  that  in  turn determines  whether  or  not  the  tax  is  included  in  the electric utility's operating revenues.
Average   Revenue   per   Kilowatthour.     Average revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  defined  as  the  cost  per unit  of  electricity  sold  and  is  calculated  by  dividing retail  electric  revenue  by  the  corresponding  sales  of electricity.  The  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is calculated  for  all  consumers  and  for  each  sector  (resi- dential,    commercial,    industrial,    and    other).    The average revenue per kilowatthour reported in this pub- lication  represents  a  weighted  average  of  consumer revenue   and   sales   within   each   sector   and   across sectors for all consumers.
Average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   is   affected   by changes in the rate schedules used by the electric util- ities and by changes in the volume of electricity sales. Because  fixed  charges  remain  constant  regardless  of the volume of sales, average revenue per kilowatthour decreases  as  the  volume  of  sales  increases.  A  change in  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  may  occur  when the  volume  of  electricity  sales  changes  (because  of  an increase/decrease   in   the   use   of   electricity   by   indi- vidual   consumers   or   an   increase/decrease   in   the number  of  ultimate  consumers)  across  all  sectors  or within  a  specific  sector.  Generally,  the  rate  schedules used  by  electric  utilities  are  designed  so  that  as  the volume  of  sales  increases,  the  revenue  increases  at  a slower    rate,    lowering    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.  The  net  effect  of  these  factors  on  the average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   presented   in   this publication has not been determined. Average revenue per  kilowatthour  is  affected  by  class  of  utility  owner- ship  and  by  class  of  service  (sector).  Consequently, data are presented in this publication by class of own- ership and sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Classes of Ownership.   The  electric  utility  industry in   the   United   States   includes   approximately   3,200 investor-owned,   publicly   owned,   cooperative,   and Federal  electric  utilities.  Historically,  investor-owned electric  utilities  have  been  most  successful  in  serving large,  consolidated  markets  where  economies  of  scale afford  the  lowest  prices.  However,  publicly  owned, cooperative,  and  Federal  electric  utilities  all  have  a role  in  producing,  transmitting,  and  distributing  elec- tricity.
Investor-owned  electric  utilities  are  privately  owned entities.  They  represent  8  percent  of  the  total  number of  electric  utilities  and  approximatelly  75  percent  of electric utility generating capability, generation, sales, and   revenue   in   the   United   States.   Like   all   private businesses,  investor-owned  electric  utilities  have  the fundamental  objective  of  producing  a  return  for  their investors.  These  utilities  either  distribute  profits  to stockholders   as   dividends   or   reinvest   the   profits. Investor-owned  electric  utilities  are  granted  service monopolies    in    certain    geographic    areas    and    are obliged  to  serve  all  consumers.  As  franchised  monop- olies,   these   utilities   are   regulated   and   required   to charge  reasonable  prices,  to  charge  comparable  prices to  similar  classifications  of  consumers,  and  to  give consumers access to services under similar conditions. Most   investor-owned   electric   utilities   are   operating companies  that  provide  basic  services  for  the  gener- ation,   transmission,   and   distribution   of   electricity. The  majority  of  investor-owned  utilities  perform  all three   functions.   They   operate   in   all   States   except Nebraska,  where  electric  utilities  consist  primarily  of municipal systems and public power districts.
Publicly  owned  electric  utilities  are  nonprofit  local government  agencies  established  to  provide  service  to their   communities   and   nearby   consumers   at   cost, returning  excess  funds  to  consumers  in  the  form  of community   contributions,   increased   economies   and efficiencies  in  operations,  and  reduced  rates.  Publicly owned   electric   utilities   include   municipals,   public power  districts,  State  authorities,  irrigation  districts, and other State organizations. Most municipal electric utilities  simply  distribute  power,  although  some  large ones  produce  and  transmit  electricity  as  well.  There are  approximately  2,000  publicly  owned  electric  utili- ties  in  the  United  States.  They  represent  about  63 percent   of   the   number   of   electric   utilities,   supply approximately   10   percent   of   generation   and   gener- ating  capability,  and  account  for  about  14  percent  of sales  and  13  percent  of  revenue.  They  obtain  their financing  from  municipal  treasuries  and  from  revenue bonds secured by proceeds from the sale of electricity. Public power districts and projects are concentrated in Nebraska,     Washington,     Oregon,     Arizona,     and California.   Voters   in   a   public   utility   district   elect commissioners or directors to govern the district inde- pendent  of  any  municipal  government.  State  authori- ties,  like  the  Power  Authority  of  the  State  of  New York  or  the  South  Carolina  Public  Service  Authority, are  agencies  of  their  respective  State  governments. Irrigation  districts  may  have  other  forms  of  organiza- tion.   In   the   Salt   River   Project   in   Arizona,   for example,  votes  for  the  board  of  directors  are  appor- tioned according to the size of landholdings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cooperative   electric   utilities   are   owned   by   their members   and   established   to   provide   electricity   to those members. These electric utilities operate in rural areas  with  low  concentrations  of  consumers  because these  areas  historically  have  been  viewed  as  uneco- nomical  operations  for  investor-owned  utilities.  There are  approximately  950  cooperatives  operating  in  47 States;  none  operate  in  Connecticut,  Hawaii,  Rhode Island,  or  the  District  of  Columbia.  Cooperative  elec- tric  utilities  represent  about  29  percent  of  U.S.  elec- tric   utilities,   approximately   8   percent   of   sales   and revenue,  and  around  4  percent  of  generation  and  gen- erating    capability.    Cooperatives    are    incorporated under   State   laws   and   are   usually   directed   by   an elected   board   of   directors,   which   in   turn   selects   a manager.   The   Rural   Utilities   Service   (formerly   the Rural   Electrification   Administration),   the   National Rural  Utilities  Cooperative  Finance  Corporation,  the Federal  Financing  Bank,  and  the  Bank  for  Cooper- atives   are   important   sources   of   debt   financing   for cooperatives.
The  10  Federal  electric  utilities  in  the  United  States are  part  of  several  agencies  in  the  U.S.  Government: the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  in  the  Department  of Defense,  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  and  the  Bureau of  Reclamation  in  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  the International  Boundary  and  Water  Commission  in  the Department  of  State,  the  Power  Marketing  Adminis- trations    in    the    Department    of    Energy    (Alaska, Bonneville,  Southeastern,  Southwestern,  and  Western Area),   and   the   Tennessee   Valley   Authority.   Three Federal  agencies  operate  Federal  generating  facilities: the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  the  largest  Federal producer;  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers;  and  the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"U.S.  Bureau  of  Reclamation.  The  Tennessee  Valley Authority  markets  its  own  power  while  generation  by the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (except  for  the North   Central   Division,   i.e.,   Saint   Mary's   Falls   at Sault  Ste.  Marie,  Michigan)  and  the  U.S.  Bureau  of Reclamation  is  marketed  by  the  Federal  power  mar- keting    administrations:    Bonneville,    Southeastern, Southwestern,   and   Western   Area.   The   four   power marketing   administrations   also   purchase   energy   for resale  from  other  electric  utilities  in  the  United  States and Canada. Alaska, the fifth power marketing admin- istration,  owned  and  operated  two  hydropower  facili- ties   (Eklutna   and   Snettisham).   On   November   28, 1995,  President  Clinton  signed  a  bill  authorizing  the sale  of  these  projects.  Final  transfer  of  title  to  the State  of  Alaska  (Snettisham)  and  three  Alaskan  utili- ties  (Eklutna)  is  anticipated  in  November  1997  after which  the  Alaska  Power  Administration  will  cease  to exist.
Federal  electric  utilities  represent  less  than  1  percent of   all   electric   utilities,   provide   approximately   10 percent  of  all  generating  capability  and  generation, and  account  for  about  2  percent  of  total  sales  to  ulti- mate  consumers  and  less  than  1  percent  of  the  associ- ated   revenue.   Federal   electric   utility   generation   is primarily  sold  for  resale  to  municipal  and  cooperative electric utilities and to other nonprofit preference con- sumers,  as  required  by  law.  Federal  power  is  sold  not for   profit,   but   to   recover   the   costs   of   operations. Federal   electric   utilities   operate   approximately   180 power  plants.  Most  of  the  power  plants  are  Federal hydroelectric   projects   initially   designed   for   flood control and irrigation purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Current Issues in the Electric Power Industry
The  electric  power  industry  is  evolving  from  a  highly regulated,   monopolistic   industry   with   traditionally structured electric utilities to a less regulated, compet- itive industry. The Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act  of  1978  opened  up  competition  in  the  generation market  with  the  creation  of  qualifying  facilities.  The Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992  (EPACT)  removed  some constraints  on  ownership  of  electric  generation  facili- ties   and   encouraged   increased   competition   in   the wholesale electric power business.
The  EPACT  amended  the  Federal  Power  Act  (FPA) such  that  any  electric  utility  can  apply  to  the  Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  for  an  order requiring   another   electric   utility   to   provide   trans- mission   services   (wheeling).   Prior   to   EPACT,   the FERC   could   not   mandate   that   an   electric   utility provide wheeling services for wholesale electric trade. This change in the law permits owners of electric gen- erating  equipment  to  sell  wholesale  power  (sales  for resale) to noncontiguous utilities.
In  April  1996,  the  FERC  issued  two  final  rules,  888 and  889,  implementing  EPACT's  provisions  for  open access to transmission lines. Rule 888 addresses equal access   to   the   transmission   grid   for   all   wholesale buyers   and   sellers,   transmission   pricing,   and   the recovery  of  stranded  costs.  Stranded  costs  are  invest- ments,  mostly  in  generation,  made  by  utilities  under the regulated environment that are presently recovered in  cost-based  rate  structures  and  may  not  be  recover- able  in  a  competitive  environment  with  market-based rates.   Rule   889   requires   jurisdictional   utilities   that own   or   operate   transmission   facilities   to   establish electronic   systems   to   post   information   about   their available  transmission  capacities.  In  response  to  these rulemakings,   utilities   are   proposing   to   form   Inde- pendent  System  Operators  (ISO)  to  operate  the  trans- mission  grid,  regional  transmission  groups,  and  open access   same-time   information   systems   (OASIS)   to inform   competitors   of   available   capacity   on   their lines.
The provision for open transmission access in EPACT has  also  facilitated  the  creation  of  new  participants  in the   electric   power   industry,   power   marketers   and power  brokers.  Power  marketers  are  entities  engaged in  buying  and  selling  wholesale  electricity  and  fall under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  FERC,  since  they  take ownership  of  electricity  and  are  engaged  in  interstate trade.  Power  brokers,  who  do  not  take  ownership  of electricity,  are  not  regulated  by  the  FERC.  A  growing number  of  power  marketers  have  filed  with  the  FERC and had rates approved. Power marketers generally do not  own  generation  or  transmission  facilities  or  sell power to retail customers. However, continuing dereg- ulation  of  the  industry  is  allowing  power  marketers the possibility of entering retail electricity markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many  State  legislatures  and  the  Congress  are  consid- ering  legislation  that  will  allow  competition  in  retail sales  of  electric  power.  In  1996,  Rhode  Island  and California  passed  bills  that  will  allow  end-use  cus- tomers  in  their  States  to  choose  among  competitive generation  suppliers.  The  plans  will  phase  in  retail choice  for  some  consumers  as  early  as  1997,  and  for all  consumers  by  2001.  Transmission  and  distribution will  remain  regulated  functions  with  rules  to  assure open  access  to  lines  for  all  competitors.  Pilot  pro- grams   for   retail   wheeling   are   underway   in   New Hampshire   and   at   major   utilities   in   several   States. This interest in retail competition points to an increas- ingly  competitive  electric  power  industry.  Presently, electric  rates  are  based  on  embedded  historical  costs. Future    electric    rates    are    likely    to    be    dynamic, reflecting  the  current  cost  of  providing  service.  In  a competitive    environment,    unbundling    of    electric power  services  and  pricing  that  reflects  time-of-day and seasonal variations will become more common.
Continuing   deregulation   at   both   Federal   and   State levels   is   transforming   the   historically   monopolistic electric   power   industry   into   a   competitive   industry that will eventually increase competition in the gener- ation  and  service  components  of  the  electric  power industry,  and  change  the  nature  of  the  way  electricity is priced, traded, and marketed in the United States.
Year in Review, 1995
In   1995,   total   sales   of   electricity   to   ultimate   con- sumers   increased   2.7   percent,   from   2,935   billion kilowatthours  (kWh)  in  1994  to  3,013  billion  kWh  in 1995.  Total  revenue  from  sales  of  electricity  to  ulti- mate   consumers   increased   2.5   percent,   from   $203 billion  in  1994  to  $208  billion  in  1995.  The  average revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  electricity  sold  to  ulti- mate consumers in the United States in 1995 was 6.89 cents,  a  slight  decrease  from  the  1994  level  of  6.91 cents.
Sales  by  Sector.    Sales  to  the  residential  sector  in 1995  increased  3.4  percent  over  the  1994  level,  to 1,043  billion  kWh,  which  represented  34.6  percent  of sales    to    ultimate    consumers.    The    nonresidential sectors1    (i.e.,  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors) increased  2.6  percent  over  the  1994  level,  to  1,875 billion  kWh,  which  represented  62.2  percent  of  sales to   ultimate   consumers.   Sales   to   the   ""other""   sector were 95 billion kWh in 1995.
Revenue   by   Sector.     For   the   residential   sector, revenue  increased  3.6  percent,  to  $88  billion  in  1995 and represented 42.2 percent of the total revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue  for  the  nonresi- dential   sectors   (i.e.,   the   commercial   and   industrial sectors)  increased  by  1.9  percent,  to  $114  billion  in 1995  and  represented  54.7  percent  of  total  revenue from  sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue  for  the ""other"" sector was $7 billion in 1995.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1  Changes  in  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors  are  discussed  collectively  as  the  nonresidential  sectors  because  from  one  year  to  the next,  utilities  may  reclassify  consumers,  moving  them  from  the  commercial  to  the  industrial  sector  or  the  reverse.  As  a  result,  year-to-year changes in these two sectors must be viewed with caution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This   chapter   presents   background   information   on revenue   requirements,   allocation   of   revenue   across sectors,   and   rate   schedules.   Summary   statistics   are provided  on  electricity  sales  to  ultimate  consumers, associated   revenue,   and   number   of   consumers   by sector   and   by   class   of   ownership   at   the   national, Census division, and State levels.
Cost of Electricity
The  process  of  determining  the  costs  of  electricity usually  occurs  in  three  stages:  (1)  revenue  require- ments  are  determined,  (2)  revenue  requirements  are allocated  to  different  sectors,  and  (3)  rate  schedules for each sector are established.
Revenue Requirements.   Revenue  requirements  are set to reimburse the electric utility for providing elec- tric  service.  They  reflect  the  anticipated  costs  of  pro- viding  services  for  some  period  of  time  in  the  future, usually  a  year.  Revenue  requirements  include  invest- ment   depreciation;   expenses   for   production,   trans- mission,    and    distribution    systems;    sales    costs; consumer costs; Federal and other taxes; and adminis- tration  and  general  expenses.  Revenue  requirements also  include  an  allowance  for  profit  in  the  case  of investor-owned electric utilities.
Allocation  of  Revenue.    Allocation  of  revenue  to each  sector  is  guided  by  the  costs  of  service  to  each sector and the type of consumers served in the sectors. For  example,  the  costs  of  service  to  the  residential sector  are  higher  than  the  costs  to  the  commercial  or industrial   sectors   because   of   residential   consumers' relatively  low  consumption  levels,  the  large  number of  residential  consumers,  and  the  extensive  distrib- ution  lines  needed  to  provide  service.  The  economic activity  or  type  of  business  of  ultimate  consumers  is not  necessarily  the  criteria  used  by  electric  utilities  to classify  consumers,  determine  revenue  requirements, and   set   rates.   Electric   utilities,   in   many   instances, determine revenue requirements and set rates based on consumers'  level  of  demand  and/or  consumption  of electricity.
The  residential  sector  represents  87.8  percent  of  ulti- mate consumers and accounts for 34.6 percent of sales to  ultimate  consumers  and  42.2  percent  of  associated revenue.  The  industrial  sector  represents  0.5  percent of  ultimate  consumers,  accounts  for  33.6  percent  of sales,  and  22.7  percent  of  revenue.  The  commercial sector  provides  10.9  percent  of  the  consumers  and accounts  for  28.6  percent  sales  and  32.0  percent  of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"revenue.  The  remaining  sales  are  made  to  the  ""other"" sector,   which   includes   public   street   and   highway lighting,  railroads  and  railways,  municipalities,  divi- sions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal  Governments under   special   contracts   or   agreements,   and   other utility departments, as defined by the pertinent regula- tory agency and/or electric utility.
Rate Schedules.   Rate schedules for electric utilities are  designed  to  reimburse  utilities  for  operation,  gen- eration,  maintenance,  rental  fees  for  equipment,  and demand   and   energy   charges.   Operation,   generation, maintenance,    and    rental    fees    for    equipment    are usually  fixed  charges  that  are  assessed  monthly  or annually.  Demand  charges  are  often  fixed,  but  can vary   with   the   peak   demand   of   the   utility.   Energy charges  vary  according  to  the  amount  of  electricity delivered.
Rate   schedules   developed   by   electric   utilities   are unique  to  each  utility.  Rate  schedules  reflect  various considerations   that   are   important   to   the   economic welfare  of  the  electric  utility  and  may  reflect  other considerations  as  well,  for  example,  residential  rates that  may  provide  economical  service  to  low-income families.  Generally,  commercial  or  industrial  billings are determined by the levels of demand and consump- tion  of  electricity  rather  than  by  consumers'  economic activity. For example, a light manufacturing establish- ment   with   a   manufacturing   process   that   consumes little   energy   may   be   billed   at   a   commercial   rate because  its  consumption  is  not  high  enough  to  qualify for  the  industrial  schedule.  Conversely,  a  large  com- mercial  building  may  have  sufficient  consumption  to be billed at an industrial rate.
Authority for approval of rate schedules is determined by  the  class  of  electric  utility  ownership.  Investor- owned  electric  utilities  are  regulated  by  State  public service  commissions  and  the  Federal  Energy  Regula- tory   Commission.   Publicly   owned   and   cooperative electric  utilities  in  most  States  are  regulated  by  their consumer-owners through locally elected or appointed officials.  A  detailed  discussion  of  utility  classes  of ownership  is  contained  in  the  ""Overview""  section  of this publication.
Tables  3  through  10  contain  data  on  electricity  sales to  the  ultimate  consumer,  associated  revenue,  average revenue per kilowatthour, and average number of con- sumers   at   the   national,   Census   division,   and   State levels  by  sector  and  class  of  ownership.  Data  for  the four   power   authorities   of   American   Samoa,   Guam, Puerto  Rico,  and  the  Virgin  Islands  are  not  included in the summary statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Average Revenue per Kilowatthour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This   chapter   presents   background   information   on average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   at   the   national, Census division, State, and electric utility levels.
Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the National, Census Division, and
State Levels
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  by  sector  and  State is  calculated  by  dividing  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate consumers in a given sector and State by the cor- responding   sales   for   that   sector   and   State.   The resulting    statistic    is    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour   sold   by   consumer   sector.   Many   rate schedules  have  a  minimum  service  charge,  and  most set  a  declining  rate  per  unit  of  consumption  as  con- sumption  increases.  Rate  schedules  for  the  commer- cial   and   industrial   sectors   almost   always   have   a demand charge in addition to an energy charge. These charges lower the average revenue per kilowatthour as consumption increases.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  the  residential sector  is  usually  higher  than  for  other  sectors,  due  to the  relatively  small  amount  of  consumption  per  con- sumer  and  the  relatively  low  load  factor.  Load  factor is  average  load  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  peak load.  Consumers  with  a  small  amount  of  consumption and  low  load  factors  are  more  costly  to  serve  per  unit of  energy  than  consumers  with  large  amounts  of  con- sumption   and   high   load   factors.   Residential   con- sumers  typically  have  low  load  factors  compared  with industrial or commercial consumers.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  the  residential sector  increased  each  year  from  1991  to  1995,  for  a net  increase  of  .36  cents  per  kilowatthour,  although the  amount  of  increase  declined  each  year.  For  the second   year,   the   commercial   and   industrial   sectors showed   a   slight   decrease   in   average   revenue   per kilowatthour;  commercial  decreased  .05  cents  since 1993,  and  industial  decreased  .19  cents  since  1993. The  decrease  in  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for the  industrial  sector  most  likely  indicates  that  some State  public  service  commissions  approved  rates  for industrial  consumers  that  more  accurately  reflect  the costs of service for that sector.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  investor-owned electric  utilities  increased  slightly  from  7.14  cents  in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1994  to  7.15  cents  in  1995;  publicly  owned  electric
utilities  decreased  from  6.10  cents  in  1994  to  6.02 cents    in    1995;    and    cooperative    electric    utilities decreased  from  7.01  in  1994  to  6.92  cents  in  1995. Investor-owned  electric  utilities  continue  to  have  the highest  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour,  surpassing cooperatives again for the fifth year. Average revenue per     kilowatthour     for     Federal     electric     utilities decreased  from  2.76  cents  in  1994  to  2.69  cents  in 1995.
Federal   electric   utilities   have   the   lowest   average revenue   per   kilowatthour   among   ownership   classes because  these  electric  utilities  have  access  to  rela- tively  low-cost  financing  and  generally  utilize  inex- pensive    hydroelectric    facilities.    Because    publicly owned  electric  utilities  also  have  access  to  relatively low-cost   financing   and   are   nonprofit   entities,   they have   lower   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   than investor-owned   electric   utilities.   Although   cooper- ative    electric    utilities    have    economic    advantages similar  to  those  of  publicly  owned  electric  utilities, cooperatives  generally  serve  sparsely  populated  areas and  provide  service  to  a  higher  percentage  of  rural residential  consumers  than  other  classes  of  utilities. Additionally, many cooperatives do not generate elec- tricity,  but  as  full  requirement  customers  of  electric utilities  with  generation  facilities,  must  pay  require- ment demand charges. As a result, cooperative electric utilities   usually   have   higher   average   revenue   per kilowatthour than publicly owned electric utilities.
Because  of  the  type  and  availability  of  capacity  and the   cost   of   fuel,   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour differs   across   U.S.   Census   divisions.   Petroleum   is generally  a  more  expensive  energy  source  than  coal and natural gas. Because the New England and Middle Atlantic Census Divisions rely primarily on petroleum to  fuel  their  generation,  they  tend  to  have  an  average revenue   per   kilowatthour   that   exceeds   the   national average.  The  East  and  West  South  Central  Divisions rely   on   gas-fired   generation   and   the   East   North Central  and  South  Atlantic  Census  Divisions  rely  on coal-fired  generation.  Because  the  Mountain  Census Division   relies   on   inexpensive   hydroelectric   gener- ation,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  in  this  region is usually below the national average for all classes of consumers.    The    Census    divisions    where    Federal hydroelectric  facilities  provide  significant  amounts  of electricity,   such   as   the   East   South   Central   Census Division,    also    have    low    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Electric  utility  demand-side  management  (DSM)  pro- grams may play a role in changing consumers' average consumption  and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour. DSM  programs  are  designed  to  modify  consumption patterns   and   encourage   efficient   use   of   electricity. DSM   programs   designed   to   reduce   system   peak demands    and    energy    requirements    have    become important   components   of   electric   utility   load   and resource   plans.   The   Energy   Policy   Act   of   1992 (EPACT) contains a section that promotes energy con- servation  and  efficiency  by  encouraging  utilities  to expand DSM programs. EPACT requires electric utili- ties  and  State  public  service  commissions  to  consider implementing     two     new     Federal     standards     that encourage   DSM:   (1)   integrated   resource   planning, which  includes  consideration  of  demand-side  options as  well  as  supply-side  options,  and  (2)  cost  recovery for   energy   efficiency   programs   that   allows   DSM program  profitability  to  be  at  least  as  attractive  as supply-side option profitability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Public  concerns  and  increasingly  strict  Federal  and State   environmental   standards   have   forced   electric utilities  to  reduce  the  release  of  air  pollutants  from power    plants.    Implementing    the    Clean    Air    Act Amendments  of  1990  is  resulting  in  installation  of additional  pollution  control  and/or  monitoring  equip- ment  and  potential  shifts  to  relatively  high-cost,  low- sulfur  fuels  that  will  eventually  affect  utility  revenue requirements and may increase electricity rates.
Tables  11  through  13  contain  summary  statistics  on the   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   of   electricity sold  at  the  national,  Census  division,  and  State  levels by  sector  and  class  of  utility  ownership.

"Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the Electric Utility Level
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  electricity  sold for each utility is calculated by dividing revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers  of  the  electric  utility  by the  corresponding  electricity  sales  to  all  sectors  by that  utility.  Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  a function     of     consumer     base,     ownership     class, geographic  location,  cost  of  fuel,  financing  arrange- ments, and other factors.
The   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   varies   by sector;  accordingly,  differences  between  utilities  may represent  differences  in  the  proportion  of  sales  to  dif- ferent sectors. Average revenue per kilowatthour for a given   utility   does   not   reflect   differences   that   may exist in its revenue structure across sectors.
Average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   to   ultimate   con- sumers for Federally owned utilities tends to be lower than  for  the  other  ownership  classes.  Among  several factors contributing to this is that Federal electric util- ities   are   primarily   wholesale   power   producers   and serve  few,  if  any,  residential  consumers.  They  also have   access   to   relatively   inexpensive   hydropower. Publicly  owned  and  cooperative  utilities  share  some advantages  that  can  result  in  lower  average  revenue per  kilowatthour  than  investor-owned  utilities:  they are  nonprofit,  have  access  to  low-cost  financing,  and have   preference   for   purchasing   Federal   wholesale power.  However,  cooperatives  generally  have  broad service areas and a high percentage of residential con- sumers because of the nature of the rural communities that  they  traditionally  serve.  Municipal  utilities  have more   consolidated   service   areas   and   likely   have   a broader  base  of  industrial  and  commercial  consumers that  cooperatives.  The  result  is  that  cooperatives  have a  higher  cost  of  service  than  municipal  utilities  and  a corresponding       higher       average       revenue       per kilowatthour.  Investor-owned  utilities  must  produce  a rate-of-return  for  their  investors  and  generally  have diverse   consumer   bases   and   utilize   various   fuels. Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  individual  utili- ties   usually   ranges   between   4   and   12   cents   per kilowatthour.
In  Alaska,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  reflects the  high  costs  of  service  associated  with  generation and  distribution  in  that  State.  Utilities  in  Alaska  typi- cally  consist  of  isolated  systems,  which  lack  an  inte-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"grated   transmission   system   and   the   advantages   of economy of scale. Of the 82 reporting electric utilities in   Alaska,   80   utilities   have   average   revenue   per kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average.  The  Power Cost   Equalization   (PCE)   subsidy   by   the   State   of Alaska was designed to compensate  consumers  served by  electric  utilities  located  in  rural  areas  where  trans- mission   access   is   limited   and   electric   power   is produced   with   expensive   diesel   gas   turbines.   The subsidy  is  allocated  to  electric  utilities  based  on  con- sumer   sector   and   demand   for   electricity   in   each sector.   Electric   utilities   that   qualify   for   the   PCE program  are  required  to  notify  consumers  of  the  cost of  electric  service  and  the  cost  minus  the  State  equal- ization.  Consumers  receiving  the  subsidy  do  not  actu- ally pay the high rates. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted   from   the   total   revenue   of   those   electric utilities  receiving  compensation  for  high  energy  costs in Tables 14 through 17 in this publication.
Electric  utilities  operating  on  islands  with  high  sea- sonal   populations   also   tend   to   have   high   average revenue  per  kilowatthour.  High  demand  charges  are needed  to  recover  the  fixed  equipment  and  operating costs  associated  with  generating  electricity  at  infre- quent  times.  These  circumstances  pertain  to  only  a few  utilities,  located  primarily  on  the  East  Coast  and in the Great Lakes area.
Tables  14,  15,  16,  and  17  present  the  number  of  ulti- mate  consumers,  retail  sales,  associated  revenue,  and average revenue per kilowatthour by State and electric utility  for  the  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and all  sectors,  respectively.  When  an  electric  utility  pro- vided  service  to  ultimate  consumers  in  more  than  one State,  the  utility  is  listed  under  each  State  it  served. Table A1 in Appendix A lists the electric utilities that provided   service   in   more   than   one   State   and   the percent of sales in each State.
Electric  revenue  and  sales  data  are  reported  by  elec- tric    utilities    in    thousand    dollars    and    thousand kilowatthours.  Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for electric   utilities   with   less   than   either   $100,000   of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours of sales is not pro- vided because the significance of these data is not suf- ficient  to  make  the  ratio  meaningful.  See  Appendix  B for   further   information.   Data   for   the   four   power authorities  of  American  Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico, and   the   Virgin   Islands   are   included   in   Tables   14 through 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenues and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •All sectors include residential, commercial, industrial, and other customers. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

The majority of electric utili- ties  that  serve  ultimate  consumers  in  more  than  one State  are  investor-owned  electric  utilities.

U.S. Department of Energy. Data published in the ESR are  compiled  from  the  EIA  statistical  survey  using Form  EIA-861,  ""Annual  Electric  Utility  Report.""  A brief summary of the form is presented below.
Form EIA-861
The  Form  EIA-861  is  a  mandatory  annual  census  of electric  utilities  in  the  United  States.  The  survey  is used   to   collect   information   on   power   production, sales,     and     demand-side-management     data     from approximately  3,200  electric  utilities.  The  collected data  are  used  to  maintain  and  update  EIA's  electric utility  frame  database.  This  database  enables  analysts to   respond   to   queries   from   the   Executive   Branch, Congress,   other   public   agencies,   and   the   general public.  Data  from  the  Form  EIA-861  also  appear  in other EIA publications: Electric Power Monthly, Elec- tric  Power  Annual,  Financial  Statistics  of  Major  U.S. Investor-Owned  Electric  Utilities,  Financial  Statistics of   Major   U.S.   Publicly   Owned   Electric   Utilities, Annual   Energy   Outlook,   and   U.S.   Electric   Utility Demand-Side   Management.    These    reports    present aggregate  totals  for  electric  utilities  at  the  national, regional, and/or State levels.
Instrument  and  Design  History.    Use  of  the  Form EIA-861 was begun in January 1985 to collect data as of  year-end  1984.  The  Federal  Energy  Administration Act  of  1974  (Public  Law  93-275)  defines  the  legisla- tive authority to collect these data.
Data  Processing.    The  Form  EIA-861  is  mailed  to the respondents at year end to collect data for the cal- endar year. The completed forms are to be returned to the  EIA  by  April  30.  The  data  are  entered  into  an interactive   on-line   system.   Internal   edit   checks   are performed to verify that current data total consistently across   and   between   schedules,   and   are   comparable with  data  reported  the  previous  year.  Edit  checks  are also  performed  to  compare  data  reported  on  the  Form EIA-861   with   similar   data   reported   on   the   Form
EIA-826, ""Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"with   State   Distributions,""   Form   EIA-412,   ""Annual Report  of  Public  Electric  Utilities,""  and  the  Federal Energy   Regulatory   Commission   Form   1,   ""Annual Report   of   Major   Electric   Utilities,   Licensees,   and Others.""  Respondents  are  contacted  by  telephone  to obtain   clarification   of   reported   data   or   to   obtain missing data.
The  Form  EIA-861  totals  shown  in  this  publication differ  somewhat  from  the  sum  of  the  monthly  Form EIA-826   data   for   sales   published   in   the   Electric Power  Monthly  and  in  issues  of  the  Electric  Power Annual  prior  to  1988.  Both  forms  use  sectorial  classi- fications    (residential,    commercial,    industrial,    and other)  based  on  the  classification  of  consumers  by  the electric  utilities.  At  the  national  level,  totals  from  the Form  EIA-861  and  Form  EIA-826  correspond  closely (within 1 percent) for all end-use sectors. Some larger differences  appear  at  the  State  level,  however,  partic- ularly  for  Tennessee,  due  to  an  inconsistency  between the  two  forms  in  the  classification  of  commerical  and and industial data.
Differences   between   the   Form   EIA-861   and   Form EIA-826 totals can also result from the Form EIA-826 sampling  procedure  and/or  from  nonsampling  error  in either   data   collection.   One   source   of   nonsampling error  in  the  Form  EIA-826  stems  from  the  practice  of filing  estimates  for  monthly  sales  and  revenue  when actual figures are not yet available. Although respond- ents   are   instructed   to   file   revisions,   they   do   not always  do  so.  The  respondents  are  also  instructed  to review  the  sum  of  their  EIA-826  monthly  data  at  the end  of  the  reporting  year  to  ensure  consistency  with Form EIA-861 annual data. Survey analysts at the EIA compare  these  data  series  and  attempt  to  resolve  any differences.  Nevertheless,  some  reporting  differences remain.
Electric   revenue   and   sales   data   are   rounded   and reported  by  electric  utilities  in  thousand  dollars  and thousand   kilowatthours.   For   this   publication,   the average  revenue  per  unit  of  electricity  sold  is  calcu- lated  by  dividing  electric  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate    consumers    by    the    corresponding    sales    of electricity.  Tables  14  through  17  do  not  indicate  the average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  electric  utilities with less than either $100,000 of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours  of  sales  because  the  significance  of  the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Quality of Data
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels    (CNEAF)    is    responsible    for    routine    data improvement   and   quality   assurance   activities.   All operations  in  this  office  are  performed  in  accordance with formal standards established by the EIA to define statistical  quality.  Data  improvement  efforts  include automated   verification   of   keyed   data,   editing   by subject   matter   specialists,   and   followup   on   nonre- spondents.  By  law,  nonrespondents  may  be  fined  or otherwise  penalized  for  not  filing  a  mandatory  EIA data  form.  Before  invoking  penalties,  the  EIA  tries  to obtain  the  required  information  by  encouraging  coop- eration of nonrespondents.
Completed   forms   received   by   CNEAF   are   sorted, screened   for   completeness   of   reported   information, and   keyed   onto   computer   tapes   for   storage   and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Calculation   Effects   of   Average   Revenue   per Kilowatthour and Sales on Revenue.

tapes  is  manually  spot-checked  against  the  forms  to certify  accuracy  of  the  tapes.  Formulas  based  on  his- torical  data  values  automatically  check  data  input  for errors.   Data   values   that   fall   outside   the   ranges accepted  by  the  formulas  are  verified  by  telephoning respondents   to   resolve   any   discrepancies.   CNEAF supports  the  quality  assurance  efforts  of  the  data  col- lectors  by  providing  advisory  reviews  of  the  structure of  information  requirements  and  of  proposed  designs for    new    and    revised    data    collection    forms    and systems.  Once  implemented,  the  actual  performance of working data collection systems is also validated.
Data Editing System
Data  from  the  Form  EIA-861  are  edited  using  auto- mated  systems.  The  edits  include  both  deterministic checks,  in  which  records  are  checked  for  the  presence and  validity  of  required  fields,  and  statistical  checks, in  which  estimation  techniques  are  used  to  validate data.
Confidentiality of the Data
The   data   collected   on   the   Form   EIA-861   used   to provide input to this report are not confidential.

Rounding Rules for Data
Given a number with r digits to the left of the decimal and  d+t  digits  in  the  fraction  part,  with  d  being  the place  to  which  the  number  is  to  be  rounded  and  t being  the  remaining  digits  that  will  be  truncated,  this number  is  rounded  to  r+d  digits  by  adding  5  to  the (r+d+1)th digit when the number is positive or by sub- tracting  5  when  the  number  is  negative.  The  t  digits are  then  truncated  at  the  (r+d+1)th  digit.  The  symbol for a rounded number truncated to zero is (*).
Data Correction Procedure
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels has adopted the following policy with respect to the   revision   and   correction   of   Form   EIA-861   data published in this report.
•    Publication    of    these    data    results    in    their finalization, at which point the database is closed.
•    Revisions   or   corrections   are   made   only   in   the event  that  a  substantial  (greater  than  1  percent) data  revision  is  received  or  a  substantial  (greater than 1 percent) error is discovered.
•    No revisions will be made without the approval of the    Director,    Coal    and    Electric    Data    and Renewables Division.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Base  Bill:    A  charge  calculated  by  taking  the  rate from    the    appropriate    electric    rate    schedule    and applying it to the level of consumption.
Base Rate:   A fixed per-kilowatthour charge for elec- tricity  consumed  that  is  independent  of  other  charges and/or adjustments.
Block Rate Schedule:   An electric rate schedule with a   provision   for   charging   a   different   unit   cost   for various   increasing   blocks   of   demand   or   energy. Usually   a   reduced   price   is   charged   on   succeeding blocks.
Census  Divisions:    The  nine  geographic  divisions  of the  United  States  established  by  the  Bureau  of  the Census,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  for  statistical analysis.  The  boundaries  of  Census  divisions  coincide with  State  boundaries.  The  Pacific  Division  is  subdi- vided into the Pacific Contiguous and Pacific Noncon- tiguous areas.
Classes  of  Service:    Groups  of  consumers  identified on  the  basis  of  shared  characteristics  for  the  purpose of  setting  common  rates  for  electric  service.  These groups  are  usually  residential,  commercial,  industrial and other.
Class   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate   schedule applicable to one or more specified classes of service, groups of businesses, or customer uses.
Commercial  Sector:    The  commercial  sector  is  gen- erally   defined   as   nonmanufacturing   business   estab- lishments,    including    hotels,    motels,    restaurants, wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health,  social, and   educational   institutions.   Electric   utilities   may classify  commercial  service  as  service  that  includes all  consumers  whose  demand  or  annual  use  exceeds some  specified  limit.  The  limit  may  be  set  by  the utility  based  on  the  rate  schedule  of  the  utility.  If certain  consumers  (e.g.,  farms  or  irrigation  projects) cannot   be   identified   as   residential,   commercial,   or industrial,  they  should  be  classified  with  the  group they   most   closely   resemble.   If   there   is   no   rate schedule  distinction,  utilities  may  define  commercial consumers   as   those   having   a   demand   of   less   than 1,000 kilowatts.
Consumer  Charge:    An  amount  charged  periodically to  a  consumer  for  such  utility  costs  as  billing  and meter  reading,  without  regard  to  demand  or  energy consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooperative   Electric   Utility:     A   group   organized under  the  law  into  a  utility  company  that  will  gen- erate,  transmit,  and/or  distribute  supplies  of  electric energy   to   a   specified   area   not   being   serviced   by another  utility.  Such  ventures  are  generally  exempt from the Federal income tax laws. Most electric coop- eratives   have   initially   been   financed   by   the   Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Cost  of  Service:    A  ratemaking  concept  used  for  the design  and  development  of  rate  schedules  to  ensure that  the  filed  rate  schedules  recover  only  the  cost  of providing  the  electric  service  at  issue.  These  costs include  operating  and  maintenance  expenses,  depreci- ation   and   amortization   expenses,   and   income   and other  taxes  that  the  regulatory  agency  finds  just  and reasonable    to    include    in    costs    considered    for ratemaking.  In  addition,  privately  owned  utilities  may include  in  the  cost  of  service  an  allowance  for  return on  capital  (usually  computed  by  applying  a  rate  of return  to  the  rate  base).  This  concept  represents  an effort  to  equate  the  costs  incurred  by  the  utility  with the  revenue  received  for  the  service  provided  to  each of the consumer classes.
Demand   (Electric):     The   rate   at   which   electric energy   is   delivered   to   or   by   a   system,   part   of   a system,  or  piece  of  equipment,  at  a  given  instant  or averaged over any designated period of time.
Demand  Charge:    The  portion  of  the  consumer's  bill for  electric  service  that  is  based  on  the  consumer's maximum electric capacity usage.
Economy  of  Scale:    The  principle  that  larger  pro- duction  facilities  have  lower  unit  costs  than  smaller facilities.
Electric  Power  Industry:    The  privately,  publicly, federally,  and  cooperatively  owned  electric  utilities and nonutilities of the United States taken as a whole. Includes  all  electric  systems  serving  the  public:  regu- lated    investor-owned    electric    utility    companies; Federal  power  projects;  State,  municipal,  and  other government-owned  systems,  including  electric  public utility districts; electric cooperatives, including gener- ation and transmission entities; and nonutilites.
Electric  Rate:    The  price  set  for  a  specified  amount of  electricity  in  an  electric  rate  schedule  or  sales  con- tract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Electric  Rate  Schedule:    A  statement  of  the  electric rate  and  the  terms  and  conditions  governing  its  appli- cation,  including  attendant  contract  terms  and  condi- tions  that  have  been  accepted  by  a  regulatory  body with appropriate oversight authority.
Electric  Utility:    An  enterprise  that  is  engaged  in  the generation,   transmission,   or   distribution   of   electric energy  primarily  for  use  by  the  public  and  that  is  the major power supplier within a designated service area. Electric   utilities   include   privately   owned,   publicly owned,  cooperatively  owned,  and  government-owned (municipals,   Federal   agencies,   State   projects,   and public power districts) systems.
Energy:   The capacity for doing work as measured by the  capability  of  doing  work  (potential  energy)  or  the conversion    of    this    capability    to    motion    (kinetic energy).  Energy  has  several  forms,  some  of  which  are easily convertible and can be changed to another form useful   for   work.   Most   of   the   world's   convertible energy   comes   from   fossil   fuels   that   are   burned   to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical   or   other   means   in   order   to   accomplish tasks.    Electrical    energy    is    usually    measured    in kilowatthours,  while  heat  energy  is  usually  measured in British thermal units.
Energy   Information   Administration   (EIA):     An independent   agency   within   the   U.S.   Department   of Energy  that  develops  surveys,  collects  energy  data, and  produces  analyses  of  energy  issues  and  models  to project    future    developments.    The    agency    must respond   to   requests   of   Congress,   other   elements within   the   Department   of   Energy,   Federal   Energy Regulatory  Commission,  the  Executive  Branch,  and its own independent needs, and must assist the general public   and   other   interest   groups   without   taking   a policy position.
Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC): A   quasi-independent   regulatory   agency   within   the Department  of  Energy  having  jurisdiction  over  inter- state  electricity  sales,  wholesale  electric  rates,  hydro- electric   licensing,   natural   gas   pricing,   oil   pipeline rates, and gas pipeline certification.
Flat   and   Meter   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  consisting  of  two  components,  the  first  of which  is  a  service  charge,  and  the  second,  a  price  for the energy consumed.
Flat   Demand   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  based  on  billing  demand  that  provides  no charge for energy.
Gigawatt (GW):   One billion watts.
Gigawatthour (GWh):   One billion watthours.
Industrial  Sector:    The  industrial  sector  is  generally defined    as    including    manufacturing,    construction, mining,   agriculture,   fishing,   and   forestry   establish- ments  under  Standard  Industrial  Classification  (SIC) codes  01  through  39.  The  utility  may  classify  indus- trial  service  using  the  SIC  codes,  or  based  on  demand or  annual  usage  exceeding  some  specified  limit.  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"limit  may  be  set  by  the  utility  based  on  its  own  rate schedule.   Sales   to   consumers   (i.e.,   farms   and   irri- gation)  that  the  utility  has  no  system  for  separating into  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  classifica- tions  should  be  classified  based  on  the  schedule  they most closely resemble. If there is no rate schedule dis- tinction,  utilities  may  define  industrial  consumers  as those  having  a  demand  equal  to  or  greater  than  1,000 kilowatts.
Interdepartmental  Sales:    Includes  amounts  charged by  the  electric  department  at  tariff  or  other  specified rates   for   electricity   supplied   by   it   to   other   utility departments.
Investor-Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that  is  investor-owned  and  organized  as  a  tax-paying business, usually financed by the sales of securities in the capital market.
Kilowatt (kW):   One thousand watts.
Kilowatthour (kWh):   One thousand watthours.
Megawatt (MW):   One million watts.
Megawatthour (MWh):   One million watthours.
Other  Sector:    Electricity  supplied  to  public  street and  highway  lighting,  other  service  to  public  authori- ties,  service  to  railroads  and  and  railways,  and  inter- departmental service.
Power  (Electrical):    An  electric  unit  of  power  called a  voltampere  is  equal  to  the  product  of  1  volt  and  1 ampere.   This   is   equivalent   to   1   watt   for   a   direct current  system,  and  a  unit  of  apparent  power  is  sepa- rated  into  real  and  reactive  power.  Real  power  is  the work-producing  part  of  apparent  power  that  measures the  rate  of  supply  of  energy  and  is  denoted  as  kilo- watts  (kW).  Reactive  power  is  the  portion  of  apparent power that does no work and is referred to as kilovars; this  type  of  power  must  be  supplied  to  most  types  of magnetic  equipment,  such  as  motors,  and  is  supplied by     generator     or     by     electrostatic     equipment. Voltamperes  are  usually  divided  by  1,000  and  called kilovoltamperes   (kVA).   Energy   is   denoted   by   the product  of  real  power  and  the  length  of  time  utilized; this product is expressed as kilowatthours.
Power   Marketers:     Business   entities   engaged   in buying,   selling,   and   marketing   electricity.   Power marketers  do  not  ususally  own  generating  or  trans- mission   facilities.   Power   marketers,   as   opposed   to Power  Brokers,  take  ownership  of  the  electricity  and are  involved  in  interstate  trade.  These  entities  must file  with  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission for approval of rate tariffs.
Public  Authorities:    Electricity  supplied  to  munici- palities  or  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal governments, usually under special contracts or agree- ments that are applicable only to public authorities.
Public Street and Highway Lighting Service:   Elec- tricity  supplied  and  services  rendered  for  the  purpose of  lighting  streets,  highways,  parks,  and  other  public",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Publicly  Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that   includes   those   utilities   operated   by   munici- palities,  political  subdivisions,  utility  or  power  dis- tricts, and State and Federal power agencies.
Railroad  and  Railway  Electric  Service:    Electricity supplied  to  railroads  and  interurban  and  street  rail- ways,  for  general  railroad  use,  including  the  propul- sion  of  cars  or  locomotives,  where  such  electricity  is supplied under separate and distinct rate schedules.
Rate   Base:     The   value   of   property   upon   which   a utility is permitted to earn a specified rate of return as established  by  a  regulatory  authority.  The  rate  base generally  represents  the  value  of  property  used  by  the utility  in  providing  service  and  may  be  calculated  by any  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following  accounting methods:  fair  value,  prudent  investment,  reproduction cost,  or  original  cost.  Depending  on  which  method  is used,  the  rate  base  includes  cash,  working  capital, materials  and  supplies,  and  deductions  for  accumu- lated  provisions  for  depreciation,  contributions  in  aid of  construction,  customer  advances  for  construction, accumulated  deferred  income  taxes,  and  accumulated deferred investment tax credits.
Residential  Sector:    The  residential  sector  includes private   homes,   including   apartment   buildings,   that consume   energy   primarily   for   space   heating,   water heating,    air    conditioning,    lighting,    refrigeration, cooking,  and  clothes  drying.  The  classification  of  an individual  consumer's  account,  where  the  use  is  both residential and commercial, is based on principal use.
Retail:    Sales  covering  electrical  energy  supplied  for residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  end-use  pur- poses.  Other  small  classes,  such  as  agriculture  and street lighting, also are included in this category.
