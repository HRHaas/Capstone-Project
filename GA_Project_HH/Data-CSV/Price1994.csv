"The  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  is  prepared  by  the Coal   and   Electric   Data   and   Renewables   Division; Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate  Fuels; Energy    Information    Administration    (EIA);    U.S. Department   of   Energy.   Information   is   provided   on electricity  sales,  associated  revenue,  average  revenue per   kilowatthour   sold,   and   number   of   consumers throughout the United States. The data provided in the Electric   Sales   and   Revenue   are   presented   at   the national,  Census  division,  State,  and  electric  utility levels.   The   information   is   based   on   annual   data reported   by   electric   utilities   for   the   calendar   year ending December 31, 1994.
The  electric  power  industry  is  experiencing  the  emer- gence  of  competitive,  market-driven  forces  that  will probably  change  the  industry  considerably  over  the next  several  years.  The  Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992 (EPACT)  removed  some  constraints  on  ownership  of electric generation facilities and encouraged increased competition  in  the  wholesale  electric  power  business. Increased   interest   in   performance-based   ratemaking and   retail   wheeling,   decreased   long-term   interest rates,  and  employee  layoffs  point  to  an  increasingly competitive  electric  power  industry.  Presently,  elec- tric   rates   are   based   on   embedded   historical   costs. Future    electric    rates    are    likely    to    be    dynamic, reflecting  the  current  cost  of  providing  service.  In  a competitive    environment,    unbundling    of    electric power  services  and  pricing  that  reflects  time-of-day and  seasonal  variations  will  become  more  common  as interaction   of   consumers   with   utilities   increases. Changes  in  the  industry  will  be  reflected  in  the  sales, revenue,  and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  data presented in this publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Target Audience
In  the  private  sector,  users  of  the  Electric  Sales  and Revenue  include  researchers,  analysts,  and  members of the electric power industry community. Other users include   financial   and   investment   institutions,   eco- nomic   development   organizations,   special   interest groups,  lobbyists,  electric  power  associations,  and  the news media.
In     the     public     sector,     users     include     analysts, researchers,    statisticians,    and    other    professionals engaged  in  regulatory,  policy,  and  program  activities for  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments.  Congress, other  legislative  bodies,  public  service  commissions, and  other  special  government  groups  also  use  infor- mation  on  general  trends  related  to  electricity  at  State and  national  levels.  Data  in  this  report  are  used  in analytical  studies  to  evaluate  new  legislation  and  reg- ulatory  alternatives  and  to  forecast  demand  for  elec- tric power.
Source of Data
Data  published  in  the  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  are compiled    from    Form    EIA-861,    ""Annual    Electric Utility  Report.""  Form  EIA-861  is  an  annual  census  of electric  utilities  in  the  United  States,  its  territories, and  Puerto  Rico.  The  form  is  used  to  collect  informa- tion  on  the  production  and  sale  of  electricity  from approximately   3,200   electric   utilities.   A   detailed description  of  the  form  is  included  in  Appendix  B, Technical Notes.
Summary Tables 1 through 13 and discussions of data at  the  national  level  do  not  include  data  for  American Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  Virgin  Islands. Data  for  these  four  power  authorities  are  included  in the  utility-level  data  displayed  in  Tables  14  through 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The   first   section   of   this   chapter   provides   a   back- ground   on   electricity   sales   to   ultimate   consumers, associated  revenue,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour sold,   classes   of   utility   ownership,   and   consumer sectors.  The  second  section  summarizes  pertinent  sta- tistics  for  electricity  sales,  associated  revenue,  and average revenue per kilowatthour for 1994.
Background
Sales,      Revenue,      Average      Revenue      per Kilowatthour,   and   Consumer   Sectors.     Electric power is an integral part of life in the United States. It is   indispensable   to   factories,   commercial   establish- ments,  homes,  and  even  most  recreational  facilities. Lack of electric power causes not only inconvenience, but  also  economic  loss  due  to  reduced  industrial  pro- duction.  Electric  utilities  are  responsible  for  ensuring an  adequate  and  reliable  source  of  electricity  to  all consumers  in  their  service  territories  at  a  reasonable cost.
Electric   utilities   are   regulated   by   local,   State,   and Federal   authorities.   Generally,   interstate   activities (those  that  cross  State  lines)  are  subject  to  Federal regulation,  while  intrastate  activities  are  subject  to State  regulation.  Wholesale  rates  (sales  and  purchases between  electric  utilities),  licensing  of  hydroelectric facilities,  questions  of  nuclear  safety  and  high-level nuclear  waste  disposal,  and  environmental  regulation are  Federal  concerns.  Approval  for  most  plant  and transmission  line  construction  and  retail  rate  levels are State regulatory functions.
State   public   service   commissions   have   jurisdiction primarily   over   the   generally   large,   vertically   inte- grated, investor-owned electric utilities that own more than  75  percent  of  the  Nation's  generating  and  trans- mission  capacity  and  serve  about  75  percent  of  ulti- mate    consumers.    There    are    approximately    250 investor-owned    electric    utilities,    2,000    publicly owned   electric   utilities,   950   consumer-owned   rural electric  cooperatives,  and  10  Federal  electric  utilities. Approximately  20  States  regulate  cooperatives,  and  7 States regulate municipal electric utilities; many State legislatures,   however,   defer   this   control   to   local municipal officials or cooperative members.
Utility  service  territories  are  geographically  distinct from  one  another.  Each  territory  is  usually  composed of many different types of consumers. Electricity con- sumers  are  divided  into  classes  of  service  or  sectors (residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and  other)  based on  the  type  of  service  they  receive.  Sectorial  classi- fication  of  consumers  is  determined  by  each  utility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and   is   based   on   various   criteria   such   as   demand levels,  rate  schedules,  Standard  Industrial  Classifica- tion   (SIC)   codes,   distribution   voltage,   accounting methods,  end-use  applications,  and  other  social  and economic   characteristics.   Electric   utilities   use   con- sumer  classifications  for  planning  (e.g.,  load  growth and  peak  demand)  and  for  determining  their  sales  and revenue  requirements  (costs  of  service)  in  order  to derive  their  rates.  Utilities  typically  employ  a  number of  rate  schedules  for  a  single  sector.  The  alternative rate schedules reflect consumers' varying consumption levels  and  patterns  and  the  associated  impact  on  the utility's costs of providing electrical service. Reclassi- fication  of  consumers,  usually  between  the  commer- cial  and  industrial  sectors,  may  occur  from  year  to year   due   to   changes   in   demand   level,   economic factors,  or  other  factors.  For  this  reason,  the  commer- cial  and  industrial  sectors  are  discussed  collectively as nonresidential sectors in some sections of this pub- lication.   The   residential   sector   remains   relatively stable from year to year.
The residential sector includes private households and apartment buildings where energy is consumed prima- rily for space heating, water heating, air conditioning, lighting,  refrigeration,  cooking,  and  clothes  drying. The   commercial   sector   includes   nonmanufacturing business establishments such as hotels, motels, restau- rants,  wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health, social,   and   educational   institutions.   Sometimes   the commercial sector includes small manufacturing facil- ities  as  well.  The  industrial  sector  includes  manufac- turing,  construction,  mining,  agriculture,  fishing,  and forestry  establishments  (SIC  codes  1  through  39).  An electric  utility  may  classify  commercial  and  industrial consumers   based   on   either   SIC   codes   or   demand and/or usage falling within specified limits. The limits are  set  by  the  electric  utility  based  on  different  rate schedules.  The  ""other""  sector  includes  public  street and  highway  lighting,  railroads  and  railways,  munici- palities,  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal Governments  under  special  contracts  or  agreements, and  other  utility  departments,  as  defined  by  the  perti- nent regulatory agency and/or electric utility.
The  revenue  associated  with  sales  to  ultimate  con- sumers   is   the   operating   revenue   reported   by   the utility.   Operating   revenue   includes   energy   charges, demand  charges,  consumer  service  charges,  environ- mental surcharges, fuel adjustments, and other miscel- laneous charges.
Among    other    costs    of    service,    utility    operating revenues    include    State    and    local    taxes,    Federal income taxes, and other taxes paid by the utility. State and  local  authorities  tax  the  value  of  plants  (property taxes),  the  amount  of  revenues  (gross  receipts  taxes),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"purchases   of   materials   and   services   (sales   and   use taxes),  and  a  potentially  long  list  of  other  items  that vary extensively by taxing authority. Federal taxes are for the most part ""payroll"" taxes. Taxes deducted from employees'   pay,   such   as   Federal   income   taxes   and employees'  share  of  Social  Security  taxes  are  not  a part  of  the  utility's  ""tax  costs,""  but  are  paid  to  the taxing   authorities   in   the   name   of   the   employees. These  taxes  are  included  in  the  electric  utility's  costs of    service    (i.e.,    revenue    requirements)    and    are included  in  the  amounts  recovered  from  consumers  in rates and reported in operating revenues.
Electric  utilities,  like  other  business  enterprises,  are required  by  various  taxing  authorities  to  collect  and remit   taxes   assessed   on   their   consumers.   In   this regard,  the  utility  serves  as  an  agent  for  the  taxing authority.  Taxes  assessed  on  consumers,  such  as  a gross   receipts   tax   or   sales   tax,   are   called   ""pass through""  taxes.  These  taxes  do  not  represent  a  cost  to the   utility   and   are   not   recorded   in   the   operating revenues  of  the  utility.  However,  taxing  authorities differ  on  whether  a  specific  tax  is  assessed  to  the utility  or  to  the  consumer,  a  difference  that  in  turn determines  whether  or  not  the  tax  is  included  in  the electric utility's operating revenues.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  defined  as  the cost  per  unit  of  electricity  sold  and  is  calculated  by dividing  retail  electric  revenue  by  the  corresponding sales    of    electricity.    The    average    revenue    per kilowatthour  is  calculated  for  all  consumers  and  for each  sector  (residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and other). The average revenue per kilowatthour reported in  this  publication  represents  a  weighted  average  of consumer  revenue  and  sales  within  each  sector  and across sectors for all consumers.
Average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   is   affected   by changes in the rate schedules used by the electric util- ities and by changes in the volume of electricity sales. Because  fixed  charges  remain  constant  regardless  of the volume of sales, average revenue per kilowatthour decreases  as  the  volume  of  sales  increases.  A  change in  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  may  occur  when the  volume  of  electricity  sales  changes  (because  of  an increase/decrease   in   the   use   of   electricity   by   indi- vidual   consumers   or   an   increase/decrease   in   the number  of  ultimate  consumers)  across  all  sectors  or within  a  specific  sector.  Generally,  the  rate  schedules used  by  electric  utilities  are  designed  so  that  as  the volume  of  sales  increases,  the  revenue  increases  at  a slower    rate,    lowering    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.  The  net  effect  of  these  factors  on  the average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   presented   in   this publication has not been determined. Average revenue per  kilowatthour  is  affected  by  class  of  utility  owner- ship  and  by  class  of  service  (sector).  Consequently, data are presented in this publication by class of own- ership and sector.
Classes of Ownership.   The  electric  utility  industry in   the   United   States   includes   approximately   3,200 investor-owned,   publicly   owned,   cooperative,   and Federal  electric  utilities.  Historically,  investor-owned electric  utilities  have  been  most  successful  in  serving
large,  consolidated  markets  where  economies  of  scale",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"afford  the  lowest  prices.  However,  publicly  owned, cooperative,  and  Federal  electric  utilities  all  have  a role  in  producing,  transmitting,  and  distributing  elec- tricity.
While  representing  only  about  8  percent  of  the  total number  of  electric  utilities,  investor-owned  utilities account for more than 75 percent of all electric utility generating  capability,  generation,  sales,  and  revenue in   the   United   States.   Like   all   private   businesses, investor-owned  electric  utilities  have  the  fundamental objective  of  producing  a  return  for  their  investors. These  utilities  either  distribute  profits  to  stockholders as  dividends  or  reinvest  the  profits.  Investor-owned electric   utilities   are   granted   service   monopolies   in certain  geographic  areas  and  are  obliged  to  serve  all consumers.  As  franchised  monopolies,  these  utilities are   regulated   and   required   to   charge   reasonable prices,  to  charge  comparable  prices  to  similar  classi- fications  of  consumers,  and  to  give  consumers  access to  services  under  similar  conditions.  Most  investor- owned  electric  utilities  are  operating  companies  that provide   basic   services   for   the   generation,   trans- mission,  or  distribution  of  electricity.  The  majority  of investor-owned  utilities  perform  all  three  functions. They   operate   in   all   States   except   Nebraska,   where electric    utilities    consist    primarily    of    municipal systems and public power districts.
Approximately  2,000  publicly  owned  electric  utilities represent  about  63  percent  of  the  number  of  electric utilities,  supply  approximately  10  percent  of  gener- ation  and  generating  capability,  and  account  for  about 14  percent  of  sales  and  13  percent  of  revenue.  Pub- licly  owned  electric  utilities  are  nonprofit  local  gov- ernment   agencies   established   to   provide   service   to their   communities   and   nearby   consumers   at   cost, returning  excess  funds  to  consumers  in  the  form  of community   contributions,   increased   economies   and efficiencies  in  operations,  and  reduced  rates.  Publicly owned   electric   utilities   include   municipals,   public power  districts,  State  authorities,  irrigation  districts, and other State organizations. Most municipal electric utilities  simply  distribute  power,  although  some  large ones  produce  and  transmit  electricity  as  well.  They obtain  their  financing  from  municipal  treasuries  and from revenue bonds secured by proceeds from the sale of  electricity.  Public  power  districts  and  projects  are concentrated    in    Nebraska,    Washington,    Oregon, Arizona, and California. Voters in a public utility dis- trict  elect  commissioners  or  directors  to  govern  the district   independent   of   any   municipal   government. State authorities, like the Power Authority of the State of  New  York  or  the  South  Carolina  Public  Service Authority,  are  agencies  of  their  respective  State  gov- ernments.  Irrigation  districts  may  have  other  forms  of organization.  In  the  Salt  River  Project  in  Arizona,  for example,  votes  for  the  board  of  directors  are  appor- tioned according to the size of landholdings.
Cooperative    electric    utilities    represent    about    29 percent   of   U.S.   electric   utilities,   approximately   8 percent  of  sales  and  revenue,  and  around  4  percent  of generation  and  generating  capability.  There  are  about 950  cooperatives  operating  in  47  States.  Cooperative electric    utilities    do    not    operate    in    Connecticut, Hawaii,  Rhode  Island,  and  the  District  of  Columbia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cooperative   electric   utilities   are   owned   by   their members   and   established   to   provide   electricity   to those members. These electric utilities operate in rural areas  with  low  concentrations  of  consumers  because these  areas  historically  have  been  viewed  as  uneco- nomical  operations  for  investor-owned  electric  utili- ties.  Cooperatives  are  incorporated  under  State  law and  are  usually  directed  by  an  elected  board  of  direc- tors, which in turn selects a manager. The Rural Utili- ties    Service    (formerly    the    Rural    Electrification Administration),  the  National  Rural  Utilities  Cooper- ative   Finance   Corporation,   the   Federal   Financing Bank,  and  the  Bank  for  Cooperatives  are  the  most important sources of debt financing.
The  10  Federal  electric  utilities  in  the  United  States represent  less  than  1  percent  of  all  electric  utilities. They  provide  approximately  10  percent  of  all  gener- ating  capability  and  generation,  but  account  for  only about  2  percent  of  total  sales  to  ultimate  consumers and  less  than  1  percent  of  the  associated  revenue. Federal electric utility generation is primarily sold for resale  to  municipal  and  cooperative  electric  utilities and   to   other   nonprofit   preference   consumers,   as required  by  law.  Federal  power  is  sold  not  for  profit, but to recover the costs of operations. Federal electric utilities   operate   approximately   180   power   plants. Most  of  the  power  plants  are  Federal  hydroelectric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"projects  initially  designed  for  flood  control  and  irri- gation purposes.
The  Federal  electric  utilities  are  part  of  several  agen- cies in the U.S. Government: the Army Corps of Engi- neers  in  the  Department  of  Defense,  the  Bureau  of Indian  Affairs  and  the  Bureau  of  Reclamation  in  the Department of the Interior, the International Boundary and  Water  Commission  in  the  Department  of  State, the  Power  Marketing  Administrations  in  the  Depart- ment   of   Energy   (Alaska,   Bonneville,   Southeastern, Southwestern,  and  Western  Area),  and  the  Tennessee Valley   Authority.   Three   Federal   agencies   operate Federal   generating   facilities:   the   Tennessee   Valley Authority,   the   largest   Federal   producer;   the   U.S. Army  Corps  of  Engineers;  and  the  U.S.  Bureau  of Reclamation.     The     Tennessee     Valley     Authority markets  its  own  power  while  generation  by  the  U.S. Army   Corps   of   Engineers   (except   for   the   North Central  Division,  i.e.,  Saint  Mary's  Falls  at  Sault  Ste. Marie, Michigan) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is    marketed    by    the    Federal    power    marketing administrations:    Bonneville,    Southeastern,    South- western, and Western Area. The four power marketing administrations  also  purchase  energy  for  resale  from other   electric   utilities   in   the   United   States   and Canada.  Alaska,  the  fifth  power  marketing  adminis- tration,  operates  its  own  power  plants  (the  Eklutna Project   and   the   Snettisham   Project)   and   distributes power to ultimate consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Year in Review, 1994
In   1994,   total   sales   of   electricity   to   ultimate   con- sumers   increased   2.6   percent,   from   2,861   billion kilowatthours  (kWh)  in  1993  to  2,935  billion  kWh  in 1994.  Total  revenue  from  sales  of  electricity  to  ulti- mate   consumers   increased   2.3   percent,   from   $198 billion  in  1993  to  $203  billion  in  1994.  The  average revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  electricity  sold  to  ulti- mate consumers in the United States in 1994 was 6.91 cents,  a  slight  decrease  from  the  1993  level  of  6.93 cents.
Sales  by  Sector.    Sales  to  the  residential  sector  in 1994  increased  1.4  percent  over  the  1993  level,  to 1,008  billion  kWh,  which  represented  34.4  percent  of sales    to    ultimate    consumers.    The    nonresidential sectors1    (i.e.,  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors) increased  3.2  percent  over  the  1993  level,  to  1,828 billion  kWh,  which  represented  62.3  percent  of  sales to   ultimate   consumers.   Sales   to   the   ""other""   sector were 98 billion kWh in 1994.
Revenue   by   Sector.     For   the   residential   sector, revenue  increased  2.1  percent,  to  $85  billion  in  1994 and represented 41.7 percent of the total revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue  for  the  nonresi- dential   sectors   (i.e.,   the   commercial   and   industrial sectors)  increased  by  2.4  percent,  to  $111  billion  in 1994  and  represented  55.0  percent  of  total  revenue from  sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue  for  the ""other"" sector was $7 billion in 1994.
Average  Revenue  per  Kilowatthour  by  Sector. For    the    residential    sector,    average    revenue    per kilowatthour increased 0.7 percent, from 8.32 cents in 1993  to  8.38  cents  in  1994.  For  the  nonresidential sectors  (i.e.,  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors), average    revenue    per    kilowatthour    decreased    0.8 percent,   from   6.15   cents   in   1993   to   6.10   cents   in 1994. Average revenue for the ""other"" sector was 6.84 cents in 1994.
Sales  by  Ownership.    Of  total  U.S.  sales  of  elec- tricity    in    1994,    investor-owned    electric    utilities accounted  for  76.3  percent  (2,238  billion  kWh);  pub- licly   owned   electric   utilities   accounted   for   14.4 percent  (422  billion  kWh);  cooperative  electric  utili- ties  accounted  for  7.8  percent  (229  billion  kWh);  and Federal  electric  utilities  accounted  for  1.6  percent  (47 billion  kWh).  For  1994,  investor-owned  electric  utili- ties  reported  a  2.3-percent  increase  (51  billion  kWh) in  sales  to  ultimate  consumers;  publicly  owned  elec- tric  utilities,  a  3.6-percent  increase  (15  billion  kWh); cooperative  electric  utilities,  a  3.3  percent  increase  (7
billion    kWh);    and    Federal    electric    utilities,    a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0.7-percent  increase  (less  than  a  billion  kWh)  over 1993.
Revenue   by   Ownership.     All   ownership   classes reported  increased  revenue  from  sales  of  electricity  to ultimate   consumers   in   1994   compared   with   1993. Investor-owned  electric  utilities  increased  revenue  by
1.9  percent,  to  $160  billion;  publicly  owned  electric utilities,  by  3.7  percent,  to  $26  billion;  cooperatives, by  3.4  percent,  to  $16  billion;  and  Federal  electric utilities, by 0.6 percent, to $1.3 billion.
Average    Revenue    by    Ownership.      In    1994, investor-owned    electric    utilities    had    an    average revenue   per   kilowatthour   of   7.14   cents,   a   slight decrease   from   7.16   cents   in   1993;   publicly   owned electric  utilities  increased  from  6.09  cents  in  1993  to
6.10   cents   in   1994;   cooperative   electric   utilities increased  from  7.00  cents  in  1993  to  7.01  cents  in 1994.  Both  publicly  owned  and  cooperative  electric utilities  had  average  revenues  per  kilowatthour  lower than  investor-owned  electric  utilities.  Publicly  owned utilities  have  access  to  low-cost  capital  and  are  not allowed  to  charge  a  return  for  profit.  Although  coop- erative  electric  utilities  have  access  to  low-cost  loans through  the  Rural  Utilities  Service,  the  high  average revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  this  ownership  group  is at  least  partly  attributable  to  the  high  costs  of  oper- ating  in  remote  rural  areas  with  low  concentrations  of consumers  and  to  providing  service  to  higher  percent- ages  of  residential  consumers  than  other  classes  of utilities.  The  lower  consumption  level  of  residential consumers,  compared  with  commercial  and  industrial consumers, results in relatively low utilization of gen- erating  equipment,  which  produces  a  comparatively high   allocation-of-demand   cost.   In   addition,   many cooperatives  do  not  generate  electricity  but,  as  full- requirement consumers of electric utilities with gener- ating    facilities,    must    pay    requirement    demand charges.  In  1994,  Federal  electric  utilities  continued to  have  the  lowest  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour,
2.76  cents,  a  slight  decrease  from  2.77  cents  in  1993. Federal  electric  utilities  generally  have  low  average revenue   per   kilowatthour   because   they   are   exempt from  income  tax,  have  access  to  low  interest  loans, and    generate    relatively    inexpensive    hydroelectric power.    In    addition,    many    Federal    hydroelectric projects  are  multipurpose  projects,  and  only  a  portion of the costs are allocated to electricity.
Tables  1  and  2  contain  summary  statistics  on  sales  of electricity  to  ultimate  consumers,  associated  revenue, and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  at  the  national level   by   sector   and   class   of   ownership.   Figures   1 through  12  illustrate  the  distribution  of  utilities;  con- sumers;    sales    to    ultimate    consumers;    associated revenue;   and   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   by class of ownership and sector.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This chapter discusses revenue requirements, the allo- cation  of  revenue  across  sectors,  and  rate  schedules. Also  provided  are  summary  statistics  on  electricity sales  to  ultimate  consumers,  associated  revenue,  and number of consumers by sector and by class of owner- ship.   This   information   is   provided   at   the   national, Census division, and State levels.
Cost of Electricity
The  process  of  determining  the  costs  of  electricity usually  occurs  in  three  stages:  (1)  revenue  require- ments  are  determined,  (2)  revenue  requirements  are allocated  to  different  sectors,  and  (3)  rate  schedules for each sector are established.
Revenue Requirements.   Revenue  requirements  are set to reimburse the electric utility for providing elec- tric  service.  They  reflect  the  anticipated  costs  of  pro- viding  services  for  some  period  of  time  in  the  future, usually  a  year.  Revenue  requirements  include  invest- ment   depreciation;   expenses   for   production,   trans- mission,    and    distribution    systems;    sales    costs; consumer costs; Federal and other taxes; and adminis- tration  and  general  expenses.  Revenue  requirements also  include  an  allowance  for  profit  in  the  case  of investor-owned electric utilities.
Allocation  of  Revenue.    Allocation  of  revenue  to each  sector  is  guided  by  the  costs  of  service  to  each sector and the type of consumers served in the sectors. For  example,  the  costs  of  service  to  the  residential sector  are  higher  than  the  costs  to  the  commercial  or industrial   sectors   because   of   residential   consumers' relatively  low  consumption  levels,  the  large  number of  residential  consumers,  and  the  extensive  distrib- ution  lines  needed  to  provide  service.  The  economic activity  or  type  of  business  of  ultimate  consumers  is not  necessarily  the  criteria  used  by  electric  utilities  to classify  consumers,  determine  revenue  requirements, and   set   rates.   Electric   utilities,   in   many   instances, determine revenue requirements and set rates based on consumers'  level  of  demand  and/or  consumption  of electricity.
The  residential  sector  represents  87.8  percent  of  ulti- mate consumers, but accounts for only 34.4 percent of sales  to  ultimate  consumers  and  41.7  percent  of  asso- ciated  revenue.  Although  the  industrial  sector  repres- ents 0.5 percent of ultimate consumers, it accounts for
34.4 percent of sales and 23.7 percent of revenue. The commercial  sector  provides  10.9  percent  of  the  con- sumers  and  accounts  for  28.0  percent  sales  and  31.3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"percent  of  revenue.  The  remaining  sales  are  made  to the  ""other""  sector,  which  includes  public  street  and highway   lighting,   railroads   and   railways,   munici- palities,  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal governments  under  special  contracts  or  agreements, and  other  utility  departments,  as  defined  by  the  perti- nent regulatory agency and/or electric utility.
Rate Schedules.   Rate schedules for electric utilities are  designed  to  reimburse  utilities  for  operation,  gen- eration,  maintenance,  rental  fees  for  equipment,  and demand   and   energy   charges.   Operation,   generation, maintenance,    and    rental    fees    for    equipment    are usually  fixed  charges  that  are  assessed  monthly  or annually.  Demand  charges  are  often  fixed,  but  can vary   with   the   peak   demand   of   the   utility.   Energy charges  vary  according  to  the  amount  of  electricity delivered.
Rate   schedules   developed   by   electric   utilities   are unique  to  each  utility.  Rate  schedules  reflect  various considerations   that   are   important   to   the   economic welfare  of  the  electric  utility  and  may  reflect  other considerations  as  well,  for  example,  residential  rates that  may  provide  economical  service  to  low-income families.  Generally,  commercial  or  industrial  billings are determined by the levels of demand and consump- tion  of  electricity  rather  than  by  consumers'  economic activity. For example, a light manufacturing establish- ment   with   a   manufacturing   process   that   consumes little   energy   may   be   billed   at   a   commercial   rate because  its  consumption  is  not  high  enough  to  qualify for  the  industrial  schedule.  Conversely,  a  large  com- mercial  building  may  have  sufficient  consumption  to be billed at an industrial rate.
Authority for approval of rate schedules is determined by  the  class  of  electric  utility  ownership.  Investor- owned  electric  utilities  are  regulated  by  State  public service  commissions  and  the  Federal  Energy  Regula- tory   Commission.   Publicly   owned   and   cooperative electric  utilities  in  most  States  are  regulated  by  their consumer-owners through locally elected or appointed officials.  A  detailed  discussion  of  utility  classes  of ownership is contained in the Overview section of this publication.
Tables  3  through  10  contain  data  on  electricity  sales to   the   ultimate   consumer,   associated   revenue,   and average  number  of  consumers  at  the  national,  Census division,  and  State  levels  by  sector  and  class  of  own- ership.  Data  for  the  four  power  authorities  of  Amer- ican   Samoa,   Guam,   Puerto   Rico,   and   the   Virgin Islands are not included in the summary statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Average Revenue per Kilowatthour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The   first   section   of   this   chapter   discusses   average revenue  per  kilowatthour  at  the  national,  Census  divi- sion,  and  State  levels.  The  second  section  focuses  on average revenue per kilowatthour at the electric utility level.
Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the National, Census Division, and
State Levels
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  by  sector  and  State is  calculated  by  dividing  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate consumers in a given sector and State by the cor- responding   sales   for   that   sector   and   State.   The resulting    statistic    is    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour   sold   by   consumer   sector.   Many   rate schedules  have  a  minimum  service  charge,  and  most set  a  declining  rate  per  unit  of  consumption  as  con- sumption  increases.  Rate  schedules  for  the  commer- cial   and   industrial   sectors   almost   always   have   a demand charge in addition to an energy charge. These charges lower the average revenue per kilowatthour as consumption increases.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  the  residential sector  is  usually  higher  than  for  other  sectors,  due  to the  relatively  small  amount  of  consumption  per  con- sumer  and  the  relatively  low  load  factor.  Load  factor is  average  load  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  peak load. Consumers whose average load is low relative to their  maximum  demand  have  low  load  factors  and  are more  costly  to  serve  than  consumers  with  high  load factors. Residential consumers typically have low load factors  compared  with  industrial  or  commercial  con- sumers.
Average    revenue    for    the    residential    sector    has increased  each  year  from  1990  to  1994;  however,  the amount of increase has been less each year. Compared to  each  previous  year,  residential  average  revenue  per kilowatthour  increased  .21  cents  in  1991,  .17  cents  in
1992, .11 cents in 1993, and only .06 cents in 1994. In 1994,  for  the  first  time  in  recent  years,  the  commer- cial,  industrial,  and  ""other""  sectors'  average  revenue per   kilowatthour   decreased   slightly:   .01   cents   for commercial,  .08  for  industrial,  and  .04  for  ""other."" Since  1990,  the  net  increase  in  average  revenue  per kilowatthour  for  the  residential  sector  was  .55  cents; the commercial sector, .39 cents; the industrial sector,
.03  cents;  and  the  ""other""  sector,  .44  cents.  The  rela- tively     small     change     in     average     revenue     per kilowatthour  for  the  industrial  sector  indicates  that some    State    public    service    commissions    probably approved   rates   for   industrial   consumers   that   more
accurately reflect the costs of service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  by  ownership  class for  investor-owned  electric  utilities  decreased  slightly from  7.16  cents  in  1993  to  7.14  cents  in  1994;  pub- licly owned electric utilities increased from 6.09 cents in 1993 to 6.10 cents in 1994; and cooperative electric utilities  increased  from  7.00  in  1993  to  7.01  cents  in 1994.   Investor-owned   electric   utilities   continue   to have  the  highest  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour, surpassing   cooperatives   again   for   the   fourth   year. Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  Federal  electric utilities  decreased  from  2.77  cents  in  1993  to  2.76
cents in 1994.
Electric  utility  demand-side  management  (DSM)  pro- grams may play a role in changing consumers' average consumption  and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour. DSM  programs  are  designed  to  modify  consumption patterns   and   encourage   efficient   use   of   electricity. DSM   programs   designed   to   reduce   system   peak demands    and    energy    requirements    have    become important   components   of   electric   utility   load   and resource   plans.   The   Energy   Policy   Act   of   1992 (EPACT) contains a section that promotes energy con- servation  and  efficiency  by  encouraging  utilities  to expand DSM programs. EPACT requires electric utili- ties  and  State  public  service  commissions  to  consider implementing     two     new     Federal     standards     that encourage   DSM:   (1)   integrated   resource   planning, which  includes  consideration  of  demand-side  options as  well  as  supply-side  options,  and  (2)  cost  recovery for   energy   efficiency   programs   that   allows   DSM program  profitability  to  be  at  least  as  attractive  as supply-side option profitability.
Public  concerns  and  increasingly  strict  Federal  and State   environmental   standards   have   forced   electric utilities  to  reduce  the  release  of  air  pollutants  from power  plants.  The  implementing  of  the  Clean  Air  Act Amendments  of  1990  are  resulting  in  installation  of additional  pollution  control  and/or  monitoring  equip- ment  and  potential  shifts  to  relatively  high-cost,  low- sulfur  fuels  that  will  eventually  affect  utility  revenue requirements and may increase electricity rates.
Federal   electric   utilities   have   the   lowest   average revenue   per   kilowatthour   among   ownership   classes because  these  electric  utilities  have  access  to  rela- tively  low-cost  financing  and  generally  utilize  inex- pensive    hydroelectric    facilities.    Because    publicly owned  electric  utilities  also  have  access  to  relatively low-cost   financing   and   are   nonprofit   entities,   they have   lower   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   than investor-owned   electric   utilities.   Although   cooper- ative    electric    utilities    have    economic    advantages similar  to  those  of  publicly  owned  electric  utilities, cooperatives  generally  serve  sparsely  populated  areas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"and  provide  service  to  a  higher  percentage  of  rural residential  consumers  than  other  classes  of  utilities. As    a    consequence,    cooperative    electric    utilities usually  have  higher  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour than publicly owned electric utilities.
Because  of  the  type  and  availability  of  capacity  and the   cost   of   fuel,   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour differs   across   U.S.   Census   divisions.   Petroleum   is generally  a  more  expensive  energy  source  than  coal and natural gas. Because the New England and Middle Atlantic Census Divisions rely primarily on petroleum to  fuel  their  generation,  they  tend  to  have  an  average revenue   per   kilowatthour   that   exceeds   the   national average.  The  East  and  West  South  Central  Divisions rely   on   gas-fired   generation   and   the   East   North Central  and  South  Atlantic  Census  Divisions  rely  on coal-fired  generation.  Because  the  Mountain  Census",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Division   relies   on   inexpensive   hydroelectric   gener- ation,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  in  this  region is usually below the national average for all classes of consumers.    The    Census    divisions    where    Federal hydroelectric  facilities  provide  significant  amounts  of electricity,   such   as   the   East   South   Central   Census Division,    also    have    low    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.2
Tables  11  through  13  contain  summary  statistics  on the   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   of   electricity sold  at  the  national,  Census  division,  and  State  levels by  sector  and  class  of  utility  ownership.

"Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the Electric Utility Level
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  electricity  sold for each utility is calculated by dividing revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers  of  the  electric  utility  by the  corresponding  electricity  sales  to  all  sectors  by that utility. Because average revenue per kilowatthour varies  by  sector,  differences  in  average  revenue  per kilowatthour  between  utilities  may  represent  differ- ences  in  the  proportion  of  sales  to  different  sectors. Accordingly,  average  revenue  for  a  given  utility  does not  reflect  differences  that  may  exist  in  its  revenue structure     across     sectors.     Average     revenue     per kilowatthour    at    the    utility    level    usually    ranges between  4  and  12  cents  per  kilowatthour,  but  may  be larger  or  smaller  for  a  particular  sector,  ownership type, or State.
Cooperative   electric   utilities   are   owned   by   their members   and   established   to   provide   electricity   to those members. These electric utilities operate in rural areas  with  low  concentrations  of  consumers  that  his- torically   have   been   viewed   as   uneconomical   oper- ations       for       investor-owned       electric       utilities. Cooperative electric utilities generally have geograph- ically   broader   service   areas   with  smaller   consumer bases  than  other  ownership  classes  and,  as  a  conse- quence,   tend   to   have   higher   average   revenues   per kilowatthour  than  other  ownership  classes.  Cooper- ative electric utilities that serve consumers in multiple States  tend  to  have  even  broader  service  areas  and higher   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour.   Average revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  not  provided  in  Tables  14 through  17  for  those  cooperative  electric  utilities  or other electric utilities with revenue less than $100,000 or  sales  less  than  1  million  kilowatthours  because  the significance of these data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
An  example  of  this  practice  is  the  Columbus  Electric Cooperative,   Incorporated,   in   New   Mexico   which serves  consumers  in  both  New  Mexico  and  Arizona. Residential average revenue per kilowatthour in Table 14  is  13.04  cents  in  New  Mexico  and  12.15  cents  in Arizona.       Commercial       average       revenue       per kilowatthour   in   Table   15   is   11.17   cents   in   New Mexico;   however,   commercial   average   revenue   per kilowatthour  is  not  provided  for  Arizona  because  the electric  utility  reported  less  than  either  $100,000  of revenue  or  1  million  kilowatthours  of  sales  in  this State.
Electric utilities that have high costs charge high rates for  electricity  to  recover  these  costs  from  their  con- sumers.   Of   the   82   reporting   electric   utilities   in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaska,    80    utilities    have    average    revenue    per kilowatthour   exceeding   the   U.S.   average.   This   is partly due to the lack of economies of scale in Alaska and  the  high  costs  associated  with  generation  and  dis- tribution. The Power Cost Equalization (PCE) subsidy by  the  State  of  Alaska  was  designed  to  compensate consumers  served  by  electric  utilities  located  in  rural areas where transmission access is limited and electric power  is  produced  with  expensive  diesel  gas  turbines. The  subsidy  is  allocated  to  electric  utilities  based  on consumer  sector  and  demand  for  electricity  in  each sector.   Electric   utilities   that   qualify   for   the   PCE program  are  required  to  notify  consumers  of  the  cost of  electric  service  and  the  cost  minus  the  State  equal- ization.  Consumers  receiving  the  subsidy  do  not  actu- ally   pay   the   high   rates.   In   Tables   14   through   17, however,  the  PCE  subsidy  has  not  been  subtracted from   the   total   revenue   of   those   electric   utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
Electric  utilities  operating  on  islands  with  high  sea- sonal   populations   also   tend   to   have   high   average revenue  per  kilowatthour.  High  demand  charges  are needed  to  recover  the  fixed  equipment  and  operating costs  associated  with  generating  electricity  at  infre- quent  times.  These  circumstances  pertain  to  only  a few  utilities,  located  primarily  on  the  East  Coast  and in the Great Lakes area.
Data  on  the  number  of  consumers,  sales  to  ultimate consumers,  associated  revenue,  and  average  revenue per kilowatthour for individual electric utilities appear in  Tables  14  through  17.  For  each  sector  (residential, commercial, and industrial) in turn, Tables 14 through 17  present  number  of  consumers,  sales,  revenue,  and average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   for   each   electric utility.  For  the  sum  of  all  sectors  (residential,  com- mercial,  industrial,  and  other),  Table  17  shows  the number   of   consumers,   sales,   revenue,   and   average revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  each  utility.  When  an electric  utility  provided  service  to  ultimate  consumers in  more  than  one  State,  the  utility  is  listed  under  each State it served. Table A1 in Appendix A lists the elec- tric  utilities  that  provided  service  in  more  than  one State and the percent of sales in each State.
Electric  revenue  and  sales  data  are  reported  by  elec- tric    utilities    in    thousand    dollars    and    thousand kilowatthours.  Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for electric   utilities   with   less   than   either   $100,000   of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours of sales is not pro- vided because the significance of these data is not suf- ficient  to  make  the  ratio  meaningful.  See  Appendix  B for   further   information.   Data   for   the   four   power authorities  of  American  Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico, and   the   Virgin   Islands   are   included   in   Tables   14 through 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1   The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2   Most  electric  utilities  in  the  State  of  Alaska  that  have  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average  compensate  their  rural  consumers through  the  State  of  Alaska  Power  Cost  Equalization  (PCE)  program.  The  PCE  program  was  designed  to  offset  the  high  generation  and  distribution  costs
that  must  otherwise  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  high  rates  for  electricity.  The  PCE  subsidy  has  not  been  subtracted  from  the  data  shown  in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3   The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Pico, and the Virgin Islands.
4   Electric  revenues  and  sales  data  are  reported  by  electric  utilities  in  thousand  dollars  and  thousand  kilowatthours.  Average  revenues  per  kilowatthour
for  electric  utilities  with  either  less  than  $100,000  of  revenue  or  less  than  1  million  kilowatthours  of  sales  are  not  provided  because  the  significance  of  the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Pueoto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1   The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2   Most  electric  utilities  in  the  State  of  Alaska  that  have  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average  compensate  their  rural  consumers through  the  State  of  Alaska  Power  Cost  Equalization  (PCE)  program.  The  PCE  program  was  designed  to  offset  the  high  generation  and  distribution  costs
that  must  otherwise  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  high  rates  for  electricity.  The  PCE  subsidy  has  not  been  subtracted  from  the  data  shown  in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3   The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Pico, and the Virgin Islands.
4   Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Pueoto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1   The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2   Most  electric  utilities  in  the  State  of  Alaska  that  have  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average  compensate  their  rural  consumers through  the  State  of  Alaska  Power  Cost  Equalization  (PCE)  program.  The  PCE  program  was  designed  to  offset  the  high  generation  and  distribution  costs
that  must  otherwise  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  high  rates  for  electricity.  The  PCE  subsidy  has  not  been  subtracted  from  the  data  shown  in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3   The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Pico, and the Virgin Islands.
4   Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Pueoto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1   The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2   Most  electric  utilities  in  the  State  of  Alaska  that  have  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average  compensate  their  rural  consumers through  the  State  of  Alaska  Power  Cost  Equalization  (PCE)  program.  The  PCE  program  was  designed  to  offset  the  high  generation  and  distribution  costs
that  must  otherwise  be  passed  on  to  consumers  in  the  form  of  high  rates  for  electricity.  The  PCE  subsidy  has  not  been  subtracted  from  the  data  shown  in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3   The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Pico, and the Virgin Islands.
4   Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Pueoto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated
statistics  unless  specified.  •All  sectors  include  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and  other  customers.  •Electric  utilities  serving  consumers  in  more  than one State are listed under each State served.

"Table  A1  lists  utilities  that  serve  ultimate  consumers in  more  than  one  State.  It  shows  the  States  served  by each  utility  and  the  percentage  of  sales  in  each  State. The  information  comes  from  Form  EIA-861,  ""Annual Electric Utility Report."" The majority of electric utili- ties  that  serve  ultimate  consumers  in  more  than  one State  are  investor-owned  electric  utilities.  These  elec- tric   utilities   generally   have   large   franchise   service areas  and  historically  have  served  retail  consumers  in more  than  one  State.  Publicly  owned  electric  utilities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"usually  are  chartered  by  municipal  or  State  govern- ments and provide service within the cities or counties where  they  are  located.  The  information  in  Table  A1 can  be  used  as  a  reference  to  Tables  14  through  17. For  example,  Table  A1  indicates  that  the  Appalachian Power   Company   serves   consumers   in   Virginia   and West    Virginia.    Tables    14    through    17    list    the Appalachian Power Company under both Virginia and West  Virginia,  showing  the  company's  sales,  revenue, and average revenue per kilowatthour in each State.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Source of Data
The  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  (ESR)  is  prepared  by the  Coal  and  Electric  Data  and  Renewables  Division; Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate  Fuels (CNEAF);  Energy  Information  Administration  (EIA);
U.S. Department of Energy. Data published in the ESR are  compiled  from  the  EIA  statistical  survey  using Form  EIA-861,  ""Annual  Electric  Utility  Report.""  A brief summary of the form is presented below.
Form EIA-861
The  Form  EIA-861  is  a  mandatory  annual  census  of electric  utilities  in  the  United  States.  The  survey  is used   to   collect   information   on   power   production, sales,     and     demand-side-management     data     from approximately  3,200  electric  utilities.  The  collected data  are  used  to  maintain  and  update  EIA's  electric utility  frame  database.  This  database  enables  analysts to   respond   to   queries   from   the   Executive   Branch, Congress,   other   public   agencies,   and   the   general public.  Data  from  the  Form  EIA-861  also  appear  in other EIA publications: Electric Power Monthly, Elec- tric Power Annual, Electric Trade in the United States, Financial   Statistics   of   Major   U.S.   Investor-Owned Electric  Utilities,  Financial  Statistics  of  Major  U.S. Publicly   Owned   Electric   Utilities,   Annual   Energy Outlook,  and  U.S.  Electric  Utility  Demand-Side  Man- agement.  These  reports  present  aggregate  totals  for electric  utilities  at  the  national,  regional,  and/or  State levels.
Instrument  and  Design  History.    Use  of  the  Form EIA-861 was begun in January 1985 to collect data as of  year-end  1984.  The  Federal  Energy  Administration Act  of  1974  (Public  Law  93-275)  defines  the  legisla- tive authority to collect these data.
Data  Processing.    The  Form  EIA-861  is  mailed  to the respondents at year end to collect data for the cal- endar year. The completed forms are to be returned to the  EIA  by  April  30.  The  data  are  entered  into  an interactive   on-line   system.   Internal   edit   checks   are performed to verify that current data total consistently across   and   between   schedules,   and   are   comparable with  data  reported  the  previous  year.  Edit  checks  are also  performed  to  compare  data  reported  on  the  Form EIA-861   with   similar   data   reported   on   the   Form",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EIA-826, ""Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue with   State   Distributions,""   Form   EIA-412,   ""Annual Report  of  Public  Electric  Utilities,""  and  the  Federal Energy   Regulatory   Commission   Form   1,   ""Annual Report   of   Major   Electric   Utilities,   Licensees,   and Others.""  Respondents  are  contacted  by  telephone  to obtain   clarification   of   reported   data   or   to   obtain missing data.
The  Form  EIA-861  totals  shown  in  this  publication differ  somewhat  from  the  sum  of  the  monthly  Form EIA-826   data   for   sales   published   in   the   Electric Power  Monthly  and  in  issues  of  the  Electric  Power Annual  prior  to  1988.  Both  forms  use  sectorial  classi- fications    (residential,    commercial,    industrial,    and other)  based  on  the  classification  of  consumers  by  the electric  utilities.  At  the  national  level,  totals  from  the Form  EIA-861  and  Form  EIA-826  correspond  closely (within 1 percent) for all end-use sectors. Some larger differences  appear  at  the  State  level,  however,  partic- ularly  for  Tennessee,  due  to  an  inconsistency  between the  two  forms  in  the  classification  of  commerical  and and industial data.
Differences   between   the   Form   EIA-861   and   Form EIA-826 totals can also result from the Form EIA-826 sampling  procedure  and/or  from  nonsampling  error  in either   data   collection.   One   source   of   nonsampling error  in  the  Form  EIA-826  stems  from  the  practice  of filing  estimates  for  monthly  sales  and  revenue  when actual figures are not yet available. Although respond- ents   are   instructed   to   file   revisions,   they   do   not always  do  so.  The  respondents  are  also  instructed  to review  the  sum  of  their  EIA-826  monthly  data  at  the end  of  the  reporting  year  to  ensure  consistency  with Form EIA-861 annual data. Survey analysts at the EIA compare  these  data  series  and  attempt  to  resolve  any differences.  Nevertheless,  some  reporting  differences remain.
Electric   revenue   and   sales   data   are   rounded   and reported  by  electric  utilities  in  thousand  dollars  and thousand   kilowatthours.   For   this   publication,   the average  revenue  per  unit  of  electricity  sold  is  calcu- lated  by  dividing  electric  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate    consumers    by    the    corresponding    sales    of electricity.  Tables  14  through  17  do  not  indicate  the average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  electric  utilities with less than either $100,000 of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours  of  sales  because  the  significance  of  the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Quality of Data
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels    (CNEAF)    is    responsible    for    routine    data improvement   and   quality   assurance   activities.   All operations  in  this  office  are  performed  in  accordance with formal standards established by the EIA to define statistical  quality.  Data  improvement  efforts  include automated   verification   of   keyed   data,   editing   by subject   matter   specialists,   and   followup   on   nonre- spondents.  By  law,  nonrespondents  may  be  fined  or otherwise  penalized  for  not  filing  a  mandatory  EIA data  form.  Before  invoking  penalties,  the  EIA  tries  to obtain  the  required  information  by  encouraging  coop- eration of nonrespondents.
Completed   forms   received   by   CNEAF   are   sorted, screened   for   completeness   of   reported   information, and   keyed   onto   computer   tapes   for   storage   and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Calculation   Effects   of   Average   Revenue   per Kilowatthour and Sales on Revenue.

tapes  is  manually  spot-checked  against  the  forms  to certify  accuracy  of  the  tapes.  Formulas  based  on  his- torical  data  values  automatically  check  data  input  for errors.   Data   values   that   fall   outside   the   ranges accepted  by  the  formulas  are  verified  by  telephoning respondents   to   resolve   any   discrepancies.   CNEAF supports  the  quality  assurance  efforts  of  the  data  col- lectors  by  providing  advisory  reviews  of  the  structure of  information  requirements  and  of  proposed  designs for    new    and    revised    data    collection    forms    and systems.  Once  implemented,  the  actual  performance of working data collection systems is also validated.
Data Editing System
Data  from  the  Form  EIA-861  are  edited  using  auto- mated  systems.  The  edits  include  both  deterministic checks,  in  which  records  are  checked  for  the  presence and  validity  of  required  fields,  and  statistical  checks, in  which  estimation  techniques  are  used  to  validate data.
Confidentiality of the Data
The   data   collected   on   the   Form   EIA-861   used   to provide input to this report are not confidential.

Rounding Rules for Data
Given a number with r digits to the left of the decimal and  d+t  digits  in  the  fraction  part,  with  d  being  the place  to  which  the  number  is  to  be  rounded  and  t being  the  remaining  digits  that  will  be  truncated,  this number  is  rounded  to  r+d  digits  by  adding  5  to  the (r+d+1)th digit when the number is positive or by sub- tracting  5  when  the  number  is  negative.  The  t  digits are  then  truncated  at  the  (r+d+1)th  digit.  The  symbol for a rounded number truncated to zero is (*).
Data Correction Procedure
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels has adopted the following policy with respect to the   revision   and   correction   of   Form   EIA-861   data published in this report.
•    Publication    of    these    data    results    in    their finalization, at which point the database is closed.
•    Revisions   or   corrections   are   made   only   in   the event  that  a  substantial  (greater  than  1  percent) data  revision  is  received  or  a  substantial  (greater than 1 percent) error is discovered.
•    No revisions will be made without the approval of the    Director,    Coal    and    Electric    Data    and Renewables Division.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Base  Bill:    A  charge  calculated  by  taking  the  rate from    the    appropriate    electric    rate    schedule    and applying it to the level of consumption.
Base Rate:   A fixed per-kilowatthour charge for elec- tricity  consumed  that  is  independent  of  other  charges and/or adjustments.
Block Rate Schedule:   An electric rate schedule with a   provision   for   charging   a   different   unit   cost   for various   increasing   blocks   of   demand   or   energy. Usually   a   reduced   price   is   charged   on   succeeding blocks.
Census  Divisions:    The  nine  geographic  divisions  of the  United  States  established  by  the  Bureau  of  the Census,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  for  statistical analysis.  The  boundaries  of  Census  divisions  coincide with  State  boundaries.  The  Pacific  Division  is  subdi- vided into the Pacific Contiguous and Pacific Noncon- tiguous areas.
Classes  of  Service:    Groups  of  consumers  identified on  the  basis  of  shared  characteristics  for  the  purpose of  setting  common  rates  for  electric  service.  These groups  are  usually  residential,  commercial,  industrial and other.
Class   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate   schedule applicable to one or more specified classes of service, groups of businesses, or customer uses.
Commercial  Sector:    The  commercial  sector  is  gen- erally   defined   as   nonmanufacturing   business   estab- lishments,    including    hotels,    motels,    restaurants, wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health,  social, and   educational   institutions.   Electric   utilities   may classify  commercial  service  as  service  that  includes all  consumers  whose  demand  or  annual  use  exceeds some  specified  limit.  The  limit  may  be  set  by  the utility  based  on  the  rate  schedule  of  the  utility.  If certain  consumers  (e.g.,  farms  or  irrigation  projects) cannot   be   identified   as   residential,   commercial,   or industrial,  they  should  be  classified  with  the  group they   most   closely   resemble.   If   there   is   no   rate schedule  distinction,  utilities  may  define  commercial consumers   as   those   having   a   demand   of   less   than 1,000 kilowatts.
Consumer  Charge:    An  amount  charged  periodically to  a  consumer  for  such  utility  costs  as  billing  and meter  reading,  without  regard  to  demand  or  energy consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooperative   Electric   Utility:     A   group   organized under  the  law  into  a  utility  company  that  will  gen- erate,  transmit,  and/or  distribute  supplies  of  electric energy   to   a   specified   area   not   being   serviced   by another  utility.  Such  ventures  are  generally  exempt from the Federal income tax laws. Most electric coop- eratives   have   initially   been   financed   by   the   Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Cost  of  Service:    A  ratemaking  concept  used  for  the design  and  development  of  rate  schedules  to  ensure that  the  filed  rate  schedules  recover  only  the  cost  of providing  the  electric  service  at  issue.  These  costs include  operating  and  maintenance  expenses,  depreci- ation   and   amortization   expenses,   and   income   and other  taxes  that  the  regulatory  agency  finds  just  and reasonable    to    include    in    costs    considered    for ratemaking.  In  addition,  privately  owned  utilities  may include  in  the  cost  of  service  an  allowance  for  return on  capital  (usually  computed  by  applying  a  rate  of return  to  the  rate  base).  This  concept  represents  an effort  to  equate  the  costs  incurred  by  the  utility  with the  revenue  received  for  the  service  provided  to  each of the consumer classes.
Demand   (Electric):     The   rate   at   which   electric energy   is   delivered   to   or   by   a   system,   part   of   a system,  or  piece  of  equipment,  at  a  given  instant  or averaged over any designated period of time.
Demand  Charge:    The  portion  of  the  consumer's  bill for  electric  service  that  is  based  on  the  consumer's maximum electric capacity usage.
Economy  of  Scale:    The  principle  that  larger  pro- duction  facilities  have  lower  unit  costs  than  smaller facilities.
Electric  Power  Industry:    The  privately,  publicly, federally,  and  cooperatively  owned  electric  utilities and nonutilities of the United States taken as a whole. Includes  all  electric  systems  serving  the  public:  regu- lated    investor-owned    electric    utility    companies; Federal  power  projects;  State,  municipal,  and  other government-owned  systems,  including  electric  public utility districts; electric cooperatives, including gener- ation and transmission entities; and nonutilites.

"Electric  Rate  Schedule:    A  statement  of  the  electric rate  and  the  terms  and  conditions  governing  its  appli- cation,  including  attendant  contract  terms  and  condi- tions  that  have  been  accepted  by  a  regulatory  body with appropriate oversight authority.
Electric  Utility:    An  enterprise  that  is  engaged  in  the generation,   transmission,   or   distribution   of   electric energy  primarily  for  use  by  the  public  and  that  is  the major power supplier within a designated service area. Electric   utilities   include   privately   owned,   publicly owned,  cooperatively  owned,  and  government-owned (municipals,   Federal   agencies,   State   projects,   and public power districts) systems.
Energy:   The capacity for doing work as measured by the  capability  of  doing  work  (potential  energy)  or  the conversion    of    this    capability    to    motion    (kinetic energy).  Energy  has  several  forms,  some  of  which  are easily convertible and can be changed to another form useful   for   work.   Most   of   the   world's   convertible energy   comes   from   fossil   fuels   that   are   burned   to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical   or   other   means   in   order   to   accomplish tasks.    Electrical    energy    is    usually    measured    in kilowatthours,  while  heat  energy  is  usually  measured in British thermal units.
Energy   Information   Administration   (EIA):     An independent   agency   within   the   U.S.   Department   of Energy  that  develops  surveys,  collects  energy  data, and  produces  analyses  of  energy  issues  and  models  to project    future    developments.    The    agency    must respond   to   requests   of   Congress,   other   elements within   the   Department   of   Energy,   Federal   Energy Regulatory  Commission,  the  Executive  Branch,  and its own independent needs, and must assist the general public   and   other   interest   groups   without   taking   a policy position.
Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC): A   quasi-independent   regulatory   agency   within   the Department  of  Energy  having  jurisdiction  over  inter- state  electricity  sales,  wholesale  electric  rates,  hydro- electric   licensing,   natural   gas   pricing,   oil   pipeline rates, and gas pipeline certification.
Flat   and   Meter   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  consisting  of  two  components,  the  first  of which  is  a  service  charge,  and  the  second,  a  price  for the energy consumed.
Flat   Demand   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  based  on  billing  demand  that  provides  no charge for energy.
Gigawatt (GW):   One billion watts.
Gigawatthour (GWh):   One billion watthours.
Industrial  Sector:    The  industrial  sector  is  generally defined    as    including    manufacturing,    construction, mining,   agriculture,   fishing,   and   forestry   establish- ments  under  Standard  Industrial  Classification  (SIC) codes  01  through  39.  The  utility  may  classify  indus- trial  service  using  the  SIC  codes,  or  based  on  demand or  annual  usage  exceeding  some  specified  limit.  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"limit  may  be  set  by  the  utility  based  on  its  own  rate schedule.   Sales   to   consumers   (i.e.,   farms   and   irri- gation)  that  the  utility  has  no  system  for  separating into  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  classifica- tions  should  be  classified  based  on  the  schedule  they most closely resemble. If there is no rate schedule dis- tinction,  utilities  may  define  industrial  consumers  as those  having  a  demand  equal  to  or  greater  than  1,000 kilowatts.
Interdepartmental  Sales:    Includes  amounts  charged by  the  electric  department  at  tariff  or  other  specified rates   for   electricity   supplied   by   it   to   other   utility departments.
Investor-Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that  is  investor-owned  and  organized  as  a  tax-paying business, usually financed by the sales of securities in the capital market.
Kilowatt (kW):   One thousand watts.
Kilowatthour (kWh):   One thousand watthours.
Megawatt (MW):   One million watts.
Megawatthour (MWh):   One million watthours.
Other  Sector:    Electricity  supplied  to  public  street and  highway  lighting,  other  service  to  public  authori- ties,  service  to  railroads  and  and  railways,  and  inter- departmental service.
Power  (Electrical):    An  electric  unit  of  power  called a  voltampere  is  equal  to  the  product  of  1  volt  and  1 ampere.   This   is   equivalent   to   1   watt   for   a   direct current  system,  and  a  unit  of  apparent  power  is  sepa- rated  into  real  and  reactive  power.  Real  power  is  the work-producing  part  of  apparent  power  that  measures the  rate  of  supply  of  energy  and  is  denoted  as  kilo- watts  (kW).  Reactive  power  is  the  portion  of  apparent power that does no work and is referred to as kilovars; this  type  of  power  must  be  supplied  to  most  types  of magnetic  equipment,  such  as  motors,  and  is  supplied by     generator     or     by     electrostatic     equipment. Voltamperes  are  usually  divided  by  1,000  and  called kilovoltamperes   (kVA).   Energy   is   denoted   by   the product  of  real  power  and  the  length  of  time  utilized; this product is expressed as kilowatthours.
Public  Authorities:    Electricity  supplied  to  munici- palities  or  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal governments, usually under special contracts or agree- ments that are applicable only to public authorities.
Public Street and Highway Lighting Service:   Elec- tricity  supplied  and  services  rendered  for  the  purpose of  lighting  streets,  highways,  parks,  and  other  public places;  or  for  traffic  or  other  signal  system  service, for  municipalities,  or  other  divisions  or  agencies  of State or Federal governments.
Publicly  Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that   includes   those   utilities   operated   by   munici- palities,  political  subdivisions,  utility  or  power  dis- tricts, and State and Federal power agencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
