"Electric Sales and Revenue 2001
* This report has been discontinued; summary 2001 data will be available in the new Electric Power Annual in January 2003; detailed data will be available on the Internet.
Executive Summary
Year in Review, 2001
In 2001, full-service sales of electricity to ""bundled"" ultimate consumers decreased to 3,225 billion kilowatthours. The steep decline is partly due to a decrease in industrial consumption related to the slowdown in the economy in 2001 as well as the transfer of substantial numbers of California customers and related energy consumption (58.9 million megawatthours) to unbundled energy service provided by the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) during California’s energy crisis.1 Unbundled sales in deregulated markets, including sales by the CDWR, increased to 145 billion kilowatthours and were approximately 4.3 percent of total sales.2 Total revenue from sales to bundled consumers increased by 4 percent from $224 billion to $233 billion. Total revenue in 2000 from both bundled and unbundled consumers was $247 billion.
Average revenue per kilowatthour continued to increase for all sectors in 2001, after steady declines during most of the 1990s. For the residential sector, average revenue per kilowatthour increased by 4.3 percent to 8.56 cents for bundled consumers and 8.62 cents for both bundled and unbundled combined.3 Similar increases in average revenue per kilowatthour were experienced by the other consumer sectors as well.

1   Effective  January  17,  2001,  the  California  State  legislature  authorized  the  California  Department  of  Water Resources (CDWR) to purchase wholesale power for California retail consumers. This action was a result of the very
high wholesale power prices and power shortages experienced in California in 2000 and 2001, and associated financial problems encountered by the State’s large investor-owned utilities. Data for 2001 related to the CDWR’s intervention",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"into the California electricity crisis are considered by the EIA to be unbundled retail energy sales by the CDWR with the  major  investor-owned  utilities  providing  delivery  services  only  to  affected  consumers.  Therefore,  these  data  are carried in Tables C1 through C4, and in File3 in the database file. The EIA’s representation of these data as retail sales by the CDWR was agreed to by the CDWR and the major California investor-owned utilities. However, users of the data should be aware that substantial definitional differences exist with regard to the type of transaction (wholesale or retail) between the CDWR, the State’s investor-owned utilities, and the California ratepayers.
2 Sales to ultimate consumers in deregulated markets, including revenue received by distribution utilities for delivery services  in  those  markets,  are  shown  in  Appendix  C  for  “Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  2000”  and  in  the  spreadsheet Tables C1 through C5 for 2001.
3  Combining  unbundled  residential  consumers  with  bundled  residential  consumers  further  increases  the  average revenue per kilowatthour because States that have deregulated their markets have done so precisely because they had higher than average costs of electric power (i.e., California, Pennsylvania, New York).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Notes: Data are final.  Commercial or industrial billings are generally determined by the level of demand and consumption of electricity rather than by consumer economic activity.  Average monthly consumption in kilowatthours is calculated by dividing the megawatthours by 12(months), dividing the results by the number of consumers, and multiplying by 1000 (to convert to kilowatthours).  The average revenue is calculated by dividing the revenue by the megawatthours, then multiplying by 100 (to convert to cents).  The average monthly bill is calculated by dividing the revenue by 12(months), dividing the result by the number of consumers, and multiplying by 1000 (to convert to dollars and cents).

"- The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
- Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program.  The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to the consumers in the form of high rates for electricity.  The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.

"- The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
- Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program.  The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to the consumers in the form of high rates for electricity.  The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
- Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours.  Average revenues per kilowatthour for small electric utilities are provided but the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
-  Information on certain sales in California related to the California Department of Water Resources' emergency intervention into California retail markets in 2001 are carried in Tables C1 through C5 (unbundled sales in deregulated markets) and are identified under ""Electric Fund (CDWR).""
- The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
Notes: ·Data are final.  ·The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified.  ·Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each state served.  ·Bundled consumers are those provided electric service by a single utility, who did not select an alternate competitive energy supplier in State ""Retail Wheeling"" programs.

"- The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
- Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program.  The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to the consumers in the form of high rates for electricity.  The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
- Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours.  Average revenues per kilowatthour for small electric utilities are provided but the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
-  Information on certain sales in California related to the California Department of Water Resources' emergency intervention into California retail markets in 2001 are carried in Tables C1 through C5 (unbundled sales in deregulated markets) and are identified under ""Electric Fund (CDWR).""
- The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
- Industrial revenue shown for the Bonneville Power Administration in Washington, Oregon and Montana includes credits back to large aluminum smelters, pursuant to contractually mandated remarketing agreements with those customers.
Notes: ·Data are final.  ·The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified.  ·Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each state served.  ·Bundled consumers are those provided electric service by a single utility, who did not select an alternate competitive energy supplier in State ""Retail Wheeling"" programs.

,"- The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
- Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program.  The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to the consumers in the form of high rates for electricity.  The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
- Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours.  Average revenues per kilowatthour for small electric utilities are provided but the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
-  Information on certain sales in California related to the California Department of Water Resources' emergency intervention into California retail markets in 2001 are carried in Tables C1 through C5 (unbundled sales in deregulated markets) and are identified under ""Electric Fund (CDWR).""
- The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
Notes: ·Data are final.  ·The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified.  ·All sectors include residential, commericial, industrial, and other customers.  ·Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each state served.  ·Bundled consumers are those provided electric service by a single utility, who did not select an alternate competitive energy supplier in State ""Retail Wheeling"" programs.

"· Total Delivery Revenues includes the ""Other"" customer category (i.e., Public Street and Highway Lighting) not shown in Residential, Commercial, and Industrial.
· Delivery-service revenues shown for California's industrial sector are negative because California's retail competition statute required affected utility distribution companies to maintain a retail customer price cap, including for those customers who selected alternate suppliers.  For customers who did not switch suppliers, losses incurred by affected utilities related to maintenance of the retail price cap are reflected in the costs of wholesale power purchased through the California Power Exchange and Independent System Operator.
