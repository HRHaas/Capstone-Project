"The  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  is  prepared  by  the Electric   Power   Division;   Office   of   Coal,   Nuclear, Electric   and   Alternate   Fuels;   Energy   Information Administration   (EIA);   U.S.   Department   of   Energy. Information  is  provided  on  electricity  sales,  associ- ated  revenue,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  sold, and   number   of   consumers   throughout   the   United States.  The  data  provided  in  the  Electric  Sales  and Revenue  are  presented  at  the  national,  Census  divi- sion, State, and electric utility levels. The information is  based  on  annual  data  reported  by  electric  utilities for the calendar year ending December 31, 1997.
Target Audience
In  the  private  sector,  users  of  the  Electric  Sales  and Revenue  include  researchers,  analysts,  and  members of the electric power industry community. Other users include   financial   and   investment   institutions,   eco- nomic   development   organizations,   special   interest groups,  lobbyists,  electric  power  associations,  and  the news media.
In     the     public     sector,     users     include     analysts, researchers,    statisticians,    and    other    professionals engaged  in  regulatory,  policy,  and  program  activities for  Federal,  State,  and  local  governments.  Congress, other  legislative  bodies,  public  service  commissions, and  other  special  government  groups  also  use  infor- mation  on  general  trends  related  to  electricity  at  State",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and  national  levels.  Data  in  this  report  are  used  in analytical  studies  to  evaluate  new  legislation  and  reg- ulatory  alternatives  and  to  forecast  demand  for  elec- tric power.
Source of Data
Data  published  in  the  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  are compiled    from    Form    EIA-861,    ""Annual    Electric Utility  Report.""  Form  EIA-861  is  an  annual  census  of electric  utilities  in  the  United  States,  its  territories, and  Puerto  Rico.  The  form  is  used  to  collect  informa- tion  on  the  production  and  sale  of  electricity  from approximately   3,250   electric   utilities.   A   detailed description  of  the  form  is  included  in  Appendix  C, Technical Notes.
National  level  data  presented  in  Tables  1  through  13 and  discussed  in  the  text  include  the  fifty  States  and the District of Columbia, but do not include American Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  Virgin  Islands. Data for the four power authorities are included in the utility-level  data  displayed  in  Tables  14  through  17. Also,    power    marketing    activities    of    marketers engaged   in   several   State   retail   wheeling   pilot   pro- grams are not included in Tables 1 through 17, but are discussed in Appendix B1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Background
Electric  power  is  an  integral  part  of  life  in  the  United States.   It   is   indispensable   to   factories,   commercial establishments,   homes,   and   even   most   recreational facilities.   Lack   of   electric   power   causes   not   only inconvenience,  but  also  economic  loss  due  to  reduced industrial  production.  Electric  utilities  are  responsible for  ensuring  an  adequate  and  reliable  source  of  elec- tricity  to  all  consumers  in  their  service  territories  at  a reasonable   cost.   Regulatory   functions   are   divided between  Federal  (wholesale)  and  State  (retail)  author- ities.
State   public   service   commissions   have   jurisdiction primarily    over    the    large,    vertically    integrated, investor-owned  electric  utilities  that  own  more  than 75 percent of the Nation's generating and transmission capacity  and  serve  about  75  percent  of  ultimate  con- sumers.  There  are  approximately  240  investor-owned electric  utilities,  2,000  publicly  owned  electric  utili- ties,  920  consumer-owned  rural  electric  cooperatives, and   10   Federal   electric   utilities.   Approximately   20 States   regulate   cooperatives,   and   7   States   regulate municipal  electric  utilities;  many  State  legislatures, however, defer this control to local municipal officials or cooperative members.
Consumer  Sectors.    Utility   service   territories   are geographically  distinct  from  one  another.  Each  terri- tory  is  usually  composed  of  many  different  types  of consumers.   Electricity   consumers   are   divided   into classes  of  service  or  sectors  (residential,  commercial, industrial, and other) based on the type of service they receive.
Sectorial  classification  of consumers  is  determined  by each  utility  and  is  based  on  various  criteria  such  as demand    levels,    rate    schedules,    North    American Industry  Classification  System  (NAICS)  codes,  dis- tribution  voltage,  accounting  methods,  end-use  appli- cations, and other social and economic characteristics. Electric utilities use consumer classifications for plan- ning  (e.g.,  load  growth  and  peak  demand)  and  for determining   their   sales   and   revenue   requirements (costs  of  service)  in  order  to  derive  their  rates.  Utili- ties  typically  employ  a  number  of  rate  schedules  for  a single  sector.  The  alternative  rate  schedules  reflect consumers'  varying  consumption  levels  and  patterns and the associated impact on the utility's costs of pro- viding electrical service.
Reclassification   of   consumers,   usually   between   the commercial  and  industrial  sectors,  may  occur  from year  to  year  due  to  changes  in  demand  level,  eco- nomic  factors,  or  other  factors.  For  this  reason,  the commercial  and  industrial  sectors  are  discussed  col-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"lectively  as  the  nonresidential  sector  in  some  sections of this publication.
The residential sector includes private households and apartment buildings where energy is consumed prima- rily for space heating, water heating, air conditioning, lighting,  refrigeration,  cooking,  and  clothes  drying. The   commercial   sector   includes   nonmanufacturing business establishments such as hotels, motels, restau- rants,  wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health, social,   and   educational   institutions.   Sometimes   the commercial sector includes small manufacturing facil- ities  as  well.  The  industrial  sector  includes  manufac- turing,  construction,  mining,  agriculture,  fishing,  and forestry   establishments   (NAICS   codes   11   through 3399).
An electric utility may classify commercial and indus- trial   consumers   based   on   either   NAICS   codes   or demand  and/or  usage  falling  within  specified  limits. The  limits  are  set  by  the  electric  utility  based  on  dif- ferent   rate   schedules.   The   “other”   sector   includes public  street  and  highway  lighting,  railroads  and  rail- ways,  municipalities,  divisions  or  agencies  of  State and  Federal  Governments  under  special  contracts  or agreements,  and  other  utility  departments,  as  defined by   the   pertinent   regulatory   agency   and/or   electric utility.
Revenue.   The  revenue  associated  with  sales  to  ulti- mate  consumers  is  the  operating  revenue  reported  by the    utility.    Operating    revenue    includes    energy charges,  demand  charges,  consumer  service  charges, environmental  surcharges,  fuel  adjustments,  and  other miscellaneous charges.
Among    other    costs    of    service,    utility    operating revenues    include    State    and    local    taxes,    Federal income taxes, and other taxes paid by the utility. State and  local  authorities  tax  the  value  of  plants  (property taxes),  the  amount  of  revenues  (gross  receipts  taxes), purchases   of   materials   and   services   (sales   and   use taxes),  and  a  potentially  long  list  of  other  items  that vary extensively by taxing authority. Federal taxes are for the most part ""payroll"" taxes. Taxes deducted from employees'   pay,   such   as   Federal   income   taxes   and employees'  share  of  Social  Security  taxes  are  not  a part  of  the  utility's  ""tax  costs,""  but  are  paid  to  the taxing   authorities   in   the   name   of   the   employees. These  taxes  are  included  in  the  electric  utility's  costs of    service    (i.e.,    revenue    requirements)    and    are included  in  the  amounts  recovered  from  consumers  in rates   and   reported   in   operating   revenues.   Taxing authorities differ on whether a specific tax is assessed to  the  utility  or  to  the  consumer,  a  difference  that  in turn  determines  whether  or  not  the  tax  is  included  in the electric utility's operating revenues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Average   Revenue   per   Kilowatthour.     Average revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  defined  as  the  cost  per unit  of  electricity  sold  and  is  calculated  by  dividing retail  electric  revenue  by  the  corresponding  sales  of electricity.  The  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is calculated  for  all  consumers  and  for  each  sector  (resi- dential,    commercial,    industrial,    and    other).    The average revenue per kilowatthour reported in this pub- lication  represents  a  weighted  average  of  consumer revenue   and   sales   within   each   sector   and   across sectors for all consumers.
Average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   is   affected   by changes in the rate schedules used by the electric util- ities and by changes in the volume of electricity sales. Because  fixed  charges  remain  constant  regardless  of the volume of sales, average revenue per kilowatthour decreases  as  the  volume  of  sales  increases.  A  change in  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  may  occur  when the  volume  of  electricity  sales  changes  (because  of  an increase/decrease   in   the   use   of   electricity   by   indi- vidual   consumers   or   an   increase/decrease   in   the number  of  ultimate  consumers)  across  all  sectors  or within  a  specific  sector.  Generally,  the  rate  schedules used  by  electric  utilities  are  designed  so  that  as  the volume  of  sales  increases,  the  revenue  increases  at  a slower    rate,    lowering    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.  The  net  effect  of  these  factors  on  the average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   presented   in   this publication has not been determined. Average revenue per  kilowatthour  is  affected  by  class  of  utility  owner- ship  and  by  class  of  service  (sector).  Consequently, data are presented in this publication by class of own- ership and sector.
Classes of Ownership.   The  electric  utility  industry in   the   United   States   includes   approximately   3,200 investor-owned,   publicly   owned,   cooperative,   and Federal  electric  utilities.  Historically,  investor-owned electric  utilities  have  been  most  successful  in  serving large,  consolidated  markets  where  economies  of  scale afford  the  lowest  prices.  However,  publicly  owned, cooperative,  and  Federal  electric  utilities  all  have  a role  in  producing,  transmitting,  and  distributing  elec- tricity.
Investor-owned  electric  utilities  are  privately  owned entities.  They  represent  8  percent  of  the  total  number of  electric  utilities  and  approximately  75  percent  of electric utility generating capability, generation, sales, and   revenue   in   the   United   States.   Like   all   private businesses,  investor-owned  electric  utilities  have  the fundamental  objective  of  producing  a  return  for  their investors.  These  utilities  either  distribute  profits  to stockholders   as   dividends   or   reinvest   the   profits. Investor-owned  electric  utilities  are  granted  service monopolies    in    certain    geographic    areas    and    are obliged  to  serve  all  consumers.  As  franchised  monop- olies,   these   utilities   are   regulated   and   required   to charge  reasonable  prices,  to  charge  comparable  prices to  similar  classifications  of  consumers,  and  to  give consumers access to services under similar conditions. Most   investor-owned   electric   utilities   are   operating companies  that  provide  basic  services  for  the  gener- ation,   transmission,   and   distribution   of   electricity. The  majority  of  investor-owned  utilities  perform  all three   functions.   They   operate   in   all   States   except",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nebraska,  where  electric  utilities  consist  primarily  of municipal systems and public power districts.
Publicly  owned  electric  utilities  are  nonprofit  local government  agencies  established  to  provide  service  to their   communities   and   nearby   consumers   at   cost, returning  excess  funds  to  consumers  in  the  form  of community   contributions,   increased   economies   and efficiencies  in  operations,  and  reduced  rates.  Publicly owned   electric   utilities   include   municipals,   public power  districts,  State  authorities,  irrigation  districts, and other State organizations. Most municipal electric utilities  simply  distribute  power,  although  some  large ones  produce  and  transmit  electricity  as  well.  There are  approximately  2,000  publicly  owned  electric  utili- ties  in  the  United  States.  They  represent  about  63 percent   of   the   number   of   electric   utilities,   supply approximately   10   percent   of   generation   and   gener- ating  capability,  and  account  for  about  15  percent  of retail  sales  and  13  percent  of  revenue.  They  obtain their  financing  from  municipal  treasuries  and  from revenue  bonds  secured  by  proceeds  from  the  sale  of electricity.   Public   power   districts   and   projects   are concentrated    in    Nebraska,    Washington,    Oregon, Arizona, and California. Voters in a public utility dis- trict  elect  commissioners  or  directors  to  govern  the district   independent   of   any   municipal   government. State authorities, like the Power Authority of the State of  New  York  or  the  South  Carolina  Public  Service Authority,  are  agencies  of  their  respective  State  gov- ernments.  Irrigation  districts  may  have  other  forms  of organization.  In  the  Salt  River  Project  in  Arizona,  for example,  votes  for  the  board  of  directors  are  appor- tioned according to the size of landholdings.
Cooperative   electric   utilities   are   owned   by   their members   and   established   to   provide   electricity   to those members. These electric utilities operate in rural areas  with  low  concentrations  of  consumers  because these  areas  historically  have  been  viewed  as  uneco- nomical  operations  for  investor-owned  utilities.  There are  approximately  920  cooperatives  operating  in  47 States;  none  operate  in  Connecticut,  Hawaii,  Rhode Island,  or  the  District  of  Columbia.  Cooperative  elec- tric  utilities  represent  about  29  percent  of  U.S.  elec- tric   utilities,   approximately   8   percent   of   sales   and revenue,  and  around  4  percent  of  generation  and  gen- erating    capability.    Cooperatives    are    incorporated under   State   laws   and   are   usually   directed   by   an elected   board   of   directors,   which   in   turn   selects   a manager.   The   Rural   Utilities   Service   (formerly   the Rural   Electrification   Administration),   the   National Rural  Utilities  Cooperative  Finance  Corporation,  the Federal  Financing  Bank,  and  the  Bank  for  Cooper- atives   are   important   sources   of   debt   financing   for cooperatives.
The  10  Federal  electric  utilities  in  the  United  States are  part  of  several  agencies  in  the  U.S.  Government: the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  in  the  Department  of Defense,  the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  and  the  Bureau of  Reclamation  in  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  the International  Boundary  and  Water  Commission  in  the Department  of  State,  the  Power  Marketing  Adminis- trations    in    the    Department    of    Energy    (Alaska, Bonneville,  Southeastern,  Southwestern,  and  Western Area),   and   the   Tennessee   Valley   Authority.

"Federal  agencies  operate  Federal  generating  facilities: the  Tennessee  Valley  Authority,  the  largest  Federal producer;  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers;  and  the
U.S.  Bureau  of  Reclamation.  The  Tennessee  Valley Authority  markets  its  own  power  while  generation  by the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (except  for  the North   Central   Division,   i.e.,   Saint   Mary's   Falls   at Sault  Ste.  Marie,  Michigan)  and  the  U.S.  Bureau  of Reclamation  is  marketed  by  the  Federal  power  mar- keting    administrations:    Bonneville,    Southeastern, Southwestern,   and   Western   Area.   The   four   power marketing   administrations   also   purchase   energy   for resale  from  other  electric  utilities  in  the  United  States and Canada. Alaska, the fifth power marketing admin- istration,  owned  and  operated  two  hydropower  facili- ties   (Eklutna   and   Snettisham).   On   November   28, 1995,  President  Clinton  signed  a  bill  authorizing  the sale  of  these  projects.  Final  transfer  of  title  to  the State  of  Alaska  (Snettisham)  and  three  Alaskan  utili- ties (Eklutna) occurred in August of 1998.
Federal  electric  utilities  represent  less  than  1  percent of   all   electric   utilities,   provide   approximately   10 percent  of  all  generating  capability  and  generation, and  account  for  1  percent  of  total  sales  to  ultimate consumers  and  less  than  .5  percent  of  the  associated revenue.  Federal  electric  utility  generation  is  prima- rily  sold  for  resale  to  municipal  and  cooperative  elec- tric    utilities    and    to    other    nonprofit    preference consumers,  as  required  by  law.  Federal  power  is  sold not  for  profit,  but  to  recover  the  costs  of  operations. Federal   electric   utilities   operate   approximately   180 power  plants.  Most  of  the  power  plants  are  Federal hydroelectric   projects   initially   designed   for   flood control and irrigation purposes.
Current Issues in the Electric Power Industry
The  electric  power  industry  is  evolving  from  a  highly regulated,   monopolistic   industry   with   traditionally structured electric utilities to a less regulated, compet- itive  industry.  The  Public  Utility  Regulatory  Policies Act  of  1978  opened  up  competition  in  the  generation market  with  the  creation  of  qualifying  facilities.  The Energy  Policy  Act  of  1992  (EPACT)  removed  some constraints  on  ownership  of  electric  generation  facili- ties   and   encouraged   increased   competition   in   the wholesale electric power business.
The  EPACT  amended  the  Federal  Power  Act  (FPA) such  that  any  electric  utility  can  apply  to  the  Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  for  an  order requiring   another   electric   utility   to   provide   trans- mission   service   (wheeling).   Prior   to   EPACT,   the FERC   could   not   mandate   that   an   electric   utility provide wheeling services for wholesale electric trade. This change in the law permits owners of electric gen- erating  equipment  to  sell  wholesale  power  (sales  for resale) to noncontiguous utilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many  State  legislatures  and  the  Congress  are  consid- ering  legislation  that  will  allow  competition  in  retail sales   of   electric   power.   In   1996,   Rhode   Island, Pennsylvania,   and   California   passed   bills   that   will allow   end-use   customers   in   their   States   to   choose among   competitive   generation   suppliers.   The   plans phased in retail choice for some consumers as early as 1997,  and  for  all  consumers  by  2001.  Transmission and  distribution  will  remain  regulated  functions  with rules  to  assure  open  access  to  lines  for  all  compet- itors.  Pilot  programs  for  retail  wheeling  are  underway in  New  Hampshire  and  at  major  utilities  in  several States.  This  interest  in  retail  competition  points  to  an increasingly    competitive    electric    power    industry. Presently, electric rates are based on embedded histor- ical   costs.   Future   electric   rates   are   likely   to   be dynamic,   reflecting   the   current   cost   of   providing service.  In  a  competitive  environment,  unbundling  of electric  power  services  and  pricing  that  reflects  time- of-day   and   seasonal   variations   will   become   more common.
Continuing   deregulation   at   both   Federal   and   State levels   is   transforming   the   historically   monopolistic electric   power   industry   into   an   industry   that   will eventually  increase  competition  in  the  generation  and service   components   of   the   electric   power   industry, and  change  the  nature  of  the  way  electricity  is  priced, traded, and marketed in the United States.
Year in Review, 1997
In   1997,   total   sales   of   electricity   to   ultimate   con- sumers    increased    1.4    percent    to    3,140    billion kilowatthours  in  1997.  Total  revenue  from  sales  of electricity    to    ultimate    consumers    increased    1.2 percent,  from  $212  billion  in  1996  to  $215  billion  in 1997.  The  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  elec- tricity sold to ultimate consumers in the United States in  1997  was  6.85  cents,  a  slight  decrease  from  the 1996 level of 6.86 cents.
Sales  by  Sector.    Sales  to  the  residential  sector  in 1997  decreased  0.6  percent  from  the  1996  level,  to 1,076  billion  kWh,  which  represented  34.3  percent  of sales    to    ultimate    consumers.    The    nonresidential sectors1    (i.e.,  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors) increased  2.3  percent  over  the  1996  level,  to  1,961 billion  kWh,  which  represented  62.5  percent  of  sales to   ultimate   consumers.   Sales   to   the   “other”   sector were 103 billion kWh in 1997.
Revenue   by   Sector.     For   the   residential   sector, revenue  increased  0.2  percent,  to  $91  billion  in  1997 and represented 42.2 percent of the total revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue  for  the  nonresi- dential   sectors   increased   by   1.8   percent,   to   $117 billion  in  1997  and  represented  54.5  percent  of  total revenue  from  sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Revenue for the “other” sector was $7 billion in 1997.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1  Changes  in  the  commercial  and  industrial  sectors  are  discussed  collectively  as  the  nonresidential  sectors  because  from  one  year  to  the next,  utilities  may  reclassify  consumers,  moving  them  from  the  commercial  to  the  industrial  sector  or  the  reverse.  As  a  result,  year-to-year changes in these two sectors must be viewed with caution.

"Average  Revenue  per  Kilowatthour  by  Sector. For    the    residential    sector,    average    revenue    per kilowatthour increased 0.8 percent, from 8.36 cents in 1995  to  8.43  cents  in  1997.  For  the  nonresidential sectors,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  decreased
0.5  percent,  from  6.01  cents  in  1996  to  5.98  cents  in 1997. Average revenue for the “other” sector was 6.91 cents in 1997.
Sales by Ownership.   Sales by investor-owned elec- tric  utilities  in  1997  increased  1.3  percent  to  2,373 billion  kilowatthours  and  represented  75.6  percent  of sales  to  ultimate  consumers.  Publicly  owned  utility sales  increased  2.0  percent  to  460  billion  kWh  and represented  14.7  percent  of  total  sales.  Cooperative utility  sales  increased  1.9  percent  to  263  billion  kWh and  represented  8.4  percent  of  sales.  Federal  utility sales  decreased  5.2  percent  to  43  billion  kWh  and represented 1.4 percent of sales.
Revenue   by   Ownership.    All   ownership   classes, except   Federal   utilities,   reported   increased   revenue from   sales   of   electricity   to   ultimate   consumers   in 1997   compared   with   1996.   Investor-owned   electric utilities   increased   revenue   by   1.1   percent,   to   $169 billion;   publicly   owned   electric   utilities,   by   2.4 percent,  to  $28  billion;  cooperatives,  by  1.0  percent, to  $18  billion;  and  Federal  electric  utilities  decreased revenue, by 10.2 percent, to $1 billion.
Average    Revenue    by    Ownership.      In    1997, investor-owned    electric    utilities    had    an    average revenue   per   kilowatthour   of   7.11   cents,   a   slight decrease   from   7.12   cents   in   1996;   publicly   owned electric  utilities  increased  from  6.01  cents  in  1996  to
6.03   cents   in   1997;   cooperative   electric   utilities decreased  from  6.74  cents  in  1996  to  6.68  cents  in 1997.  Federal  electric  utilities  average  revenue  per kilowatthour  was  2.39  cents,  a  slight  decrease  from
2.52 cents in 1996.
Tables  1  and  2  contain  summary  statistics  on  sales  of electricity  to  ultimate  consumers,  associated  revenue, and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  at  the  national level   by   sector   and   class   of   ownership.   Figures   1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"through  12  illustrate  the  distribution  of  utilities;  con- sumers;    sales    to    ultimate    consumers;    associated revenue;   and   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   by class of ownership and sector.
Average  Monthly  Bill.    For  residential  consumers, average monthly consumption is related to the average cost  per  kilowatthour  to  the  consumer.  For  instance, of   the   nine   contiguous   Census   Divisions,   the   New England  Division  has  the  highest  average  cost  to  con- sumers  per  kilowatthour,  12.06  cents;  however,  it  has the    lowest    average    monthly    consumption,    574 kilowatthours, with an average monthly bill of $69.25. Conversely,  the  East  South  Central  Division  has  the lowest  average  cost  per  kilowatthour,  6.27  cents,  with the   highest   average   monthly   consumption   at   1,138 kilowatthours,   but   has   an   average   monthly   bill   of
$71.39.   The   difference   between   residential   average monthly   bills   for   these   divisions,   each   at   opposite extremes  of  cost  and  usage,  is  only  $2.19  per  month. The  findings  reflect  consumer  adaptability  to  the  cost of a product or service.
Looking   at   State-level   data,   the   Pacific   Division further   illustrates   that   consumers   seek   alternatives when   faced   with   high   prices   for   electric   power. California  data  shows  a  relatively  high  average  utility cost to consumers per kilowatthour at 11.50 cents, but low      average      monthly      consumption      of      542 kilowatthours.   When   consumers   have   inexpensive electricity,     more     electric     power     is     consumed. Washington    utilities    receive    the    lowest    average revenue  per  kilwatthour  sold  at  4.95  cents,  yet  con- sumers  in  that  State  have  the  third  highest  average monthly  consumption  of  1,149  kilowatthours.  Never- theless,  the  difference  between  the  highest  monthly bill  ($62.37  in  California)  and  the  lowest  ($56.89  in Washington) is only $5.48 per month.
The    following    chart    shows    average    residential monthly   consumption,   average   utility   revenue   per kilowatthour,   and   average   monthly   bill   by   Census Division and State. The data illustrate the relationship between  the  cost  of  power  and  patterns  of  consump- tion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This   chapter   presents   background   information   on revenue   requirements,   allocation   of   revenue   across sectors,   and   rate   schedules.   Summary   statistics   are provided  on  electricity  sales  to  ultimate  consumers, associated   revenue,   and   number   of   consumers   by sector   and   by   class   of   ownership   at   the   national, Census division, and State levels.
Cost of Electricity
The  process  of  determining  the  costs  of  electricity usually  occurs  in  three  stages:  (1)  revenue  require- ments  are  determined,  (2)  revenue  requirements  are allocated  to  different  sectors,  and  (3)  rate  schedules for each sector are established.
Revenue Requirements.   Revenue  requirements  are set to reimburse the electric utility for providing elec- tric  service.  They  reflect  the  anticipated  costs  of  pro- viding  services  for  some  period  of  time  in  the  future, usually  a  year.  Revenue  requirements  include  invest- ment   depreciation;   expenses   for   production,   trans- mission,    and    distribution    systems;    sales    costs; consumer costs; Federal and other taxes; and adminis- tration  and  general  expenses.  Revenue  requirements also  include  an  allowance  for  profit  in  the  case  of investor-owned electric utilities.
Allocation  of  Revenue.    Allocation  of  revenue  to each  sector  is  guided  by  the  costs  of  service  to  each sector and the type of consumers served in the sectors. For  example,  the  costs  of  service  to  the  residential sector  are  higher  than  the  costs  to  the  commercial  or industrial   sectors   because   of   residential   consumers' relatively  low  consumption  levels,  the  large  number of  residential  consumers,  and  the  extensive  distrib- ution  lines  needed  to  provide  service.  The  economic activity  or  type  of  business  of  ultimate  consumers  is not  necessarily  the  criteria  used  by  electric  utilities  to classify  consumers,  determine  revenue  requirements, and   set   rates.   Electric   utilities,   in   many   instances, determine revenue requirements and set rates based on consumers'  level  of  demand  and/or  consumption  of electricity.
The  residential  sector  represents  87.7  percent  of  ulti- mate consumers and accounts for 34.3 percent of sales to  ultimate  consumers  and  42.2  percent  of  associated revenue.  The  industrial  sector  represents  0.5  percent of  ultimate  consumers,  accounts  for  32.9  percent  of sales,  and  21.7  percent  of  revenue.  The  commercial sector  provides  11.1  percent  of  the  consumers  and accounts  for  29.6  percent  sales  and  32.8  percent  of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"revenue.  The  remaining  sales  are  made  to  the  “other” sector,   which   includes   public   street   and   highway lighting,  railroads  and  railways,  municipalities,  divi- sions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal  Governments under   special   contracts   or   agreements,   and   other utility departments, as defined by the pertinent regula- tory agency and/or electric utility.
Rate Schedules.   Rate schedules for electric utilities are  designed  to  reimburse  utilities  for  operation,  gen- eration,  maintenance,  rental  fees  for  equipment,  and demand   and   energy   charges.   Operation,   generation, maintenance,    and    rental    fees    for    equipment    are usually  fixed  charges  that  are  assessed  monthly  or annually.  Demand  charges  are  often  fixed,  but  can vary   with   the   peak   demand   of   the   utility.   Energy charges  vary  according  to  the  amount  of  electricity delivered.
Rate   schedules   developed   by   electric   utilities   are unique  to  each  utility.  Rate  schedules  reflect  various considerations   that   are   important   to   the   economic welfare  of  the  electric  utility  and  may  reflect  other considerations  as  well,  for  example,  residential  rates that  may  provide  economical  service  to  low-income families.  Generally,  commercial  or  industrial  billings are determined by the levels of demand and consump- tion  of  electricity  rather  than  by  consumers'  economic activity. For example, a light manufacturing establish- ment   with   a   manufacturing   process   that   consumes little   energy   may   be   billed   at   a   commercial   rate because  its  consumption  is  not  high  enough  to  qualify for  the  industrial  schedule.  Conversely,  a  large  com- mercial  building  may  have  sufficient  consumption  to be billed at an industrial rate.
Authority for approval of rate schedules is determined by  the  class  of  electric  utility  ownership.  Investor- owned  electric  utilities  are  regulated  by  State  public service  commissions  and  the  Federal  Energy  Regula- tory   Commission.   Publicly   owned   and   cooperative electric  utilities  in  most  States  are  regulated  by  their consumer-owners through locally elected or appointed officials.  A  detailed  discussion  of  utility  classes  of ownership  is  contained  in  the  ""Overview""  section  of this publication.
Tables  3  through  10  contain  data  on  electricity  sales to   the   ultimate   consumer,   associated   revenue,   and average  number  of  consumers  at  the  national,  Census division,  and  State  levels  by  sector  and  class  of  own- ership.  Data  for  the  four  power  authorities  of  Amer- ican   Samoa,   Guam,   Puerto   Rico,   and   the   Virgin Islands are not included in the summary statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Average Revenue per Kilowatthour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This   chapter   presents   background   information   on average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   at   the   national, Census division, State, and electric utility levels.
Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the National, Census Division, and
State Levels
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  by  sector  and  State is  calculated  by  dividing  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate consumers in a given sector and State by the cor- responding   sales   for   that   sector   and   State.   The resulting    statistic    is    the    average    revenue    per kilowatthour   sold   by   consumer   sector.   Many   rate schedules  have  a  minimum  service  charge,  and  most set  a  declining  rate  per  unit  of  consumption  as  con- sumption  increases.  Rate  schedules  for  the  commer- cial   and   industrial   sectors   almost   always   have   a demand charge in addition to an energy charge. These charges lower the average revenue per kilowatthour as consumption increases.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  the  residential sector  is  usually  higher  than  for  other  sectors,  due  to the  relatively  small  amount  of  consumption  per  con- sumer  and  the  relatively  low  load  factor.  Load  factor is  average  load  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  peak load.  Consumers  with  a  small  amount  of  consumption and  low  load  factors  are  more  costly  to  serve  per  unit of  energy  than  consumers  with  large  amounts  of  con- sumption   and   high   load   factors.   Residential   con- sumers  typically  have  low  load  factors  compared  with industrial or commercial consumers.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  the  residential sector  increased  each  year  from  1993  through  1995, declined  in  1996,  and  increased  again  in  1997,  for  a net  increase  of  0.11  cents  per  kilowatthour.  For  the fourth   year,   the   commercial   and   industrial   sectors showed   a   slight   decrease   in   average   revenue   per kilowatthour;  commercial  decreased  .15  cents  since 1993,  and  industrial  decreased  .32  cents  since  1993. The  decrease  in  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for the  industrial  sector  most  likely  indicates  that  some State  public  service  commissions  approved  rates  for industrial  consumers  that  more  accurately  reflect  the costs of service for that sector.
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  investor-owned electric  utilities  decreased  slightly  from  7.12  cents  in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1996  to  7.11  cents  in  1997;  publicly  owned  electric
utilities  increased  from  6.01  cents  in  1996  to  6.03 cents    in    1997;    and    cooperative    electric    utilities decreased  from  6.74  in  1996  to  6.68  cents  in  1997. Investor-owned  electric  utilities  continue  to  have  the highest  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour,  surpassing cooperatives   again   for   the   seventh   year.   Average revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  Federal  electric  utilities decreased  from  2.52  cents  in  1996  to  2.39  cents  in 1997.
Federal   electric   utilities   have   the   lowest   average revenue   per   kilowatthour   among   ownership   classes because  these  electric  utilities  have  access  to  rela- tively  low-cost  financing  and  generally  utilize  inex- pensive    hydroelectric    facilities.    Because    publicly owned  electric  utilities  also  have  access  to  relatively low-cost   financing   and   are   nonprofit   entities,   they have   lower   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   than investor-owned   electric   utilities.   Although   cooper- ative    electric    utilities    have    economic    advantages similar  to  those  of  publicly  owned  electric  utilities, cooperatives  generally  serve  sparsely  populated  areas and  provide  service  to  a  higher  percentage  of  rural residential  consumers  than  other  classes  of  utilities. Additionally, many cooperatives do not generate elec- tricity,  but  as  full  requirement  customers  of  electric utilities  with  generation  facilities,  must  pay  require- ment demand charges. As a result, cooperative electric utilities   usually   have   higher   average   revenue   per kilowatthour than publicly owned electric utilities.
Because  of  the  type  and  availability  of  capacity  and the   cost   of   fuel,   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour differs   across   U.S.   Census   divisions.   Petroleum   is generally  a  more  expensive  energy  source  than  coal and natural gas. Because the New England and Middle Atlantic Census Divisions rely primarily on petroleum to  fuel  their  generation,  they  tend  to  have  an  average revenue   per   kilowatthour   that   exceeds   the   national average.  The  East  and  West  South  Central  Divisions rely   on   gas-fired   generation   and   the   East   North Central  and  South  Atlantic  Census  Divisions  rely  on coal-fired  generation.  Because  the  Mountain  Census Division   relies   on   inexpensive   hydroelectric   gener- ation,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  in  this  region is usually below the national average for all classes of consumers.    The    Census    divisions    where    Federal hydroelectric  facilities  provide  significant  amounts  of electricity,   such   as   the   East   South   Central   Census Division,    also    have    low    average    revenue    per kilowatthour.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Electric  utility  demand-side  management  (DSM)  pro- grams may play a role in changing consumers' average consumption  and  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour. DSM  programs  are  designed  to  modify  consumption patterns   and   encourage   efficient   use   of   electricity. DSM   programs   designed   to   reduce   system   peak demands    and    energy    requirements    have    become important   components   of   electric   utility   load   and resource   plans.   The   Energy   Policy   Act   of   1992 (EPACT) contains a section that promotes energy con- servation  and  efficiency  by  encouraging  utilities  to expand DSM programs. EPACT requires electric utili- ties  and  State  public  service  commissions  to  consider implementing     two     new     Federal     standards     that encourage   DSM:   (1)   integrated   resource   planning, which  includes  consideration  of  demand-side  options as  well  as  supply-side  options,  and  (2)  cost  recovery for   energy   efficiency   programs   that   allows   DSM program  profitability  to  be  at  least  as  attractive  as supply-side option profitability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Public  concerns  and  increasingly  strict  Federal  and State   environmental   standards   have   forced   electric utilities  to  reduce  the  release  of  air  pollutants  from power    plants.    Implementing    the    Clean    Air    Act Amendments  of  1990  is  resulting  in  installation  of additional  pollution  control  and/or  monitoring  equip- ment  and  potential  shifts  to  relatively  high-cost,  low- sulfur  fuels  that  will  eventually  affect  utility  revenue requirements and may increase electricity rates.
Tables  11  through  13  contain  summary  statistics  on the   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   of   electricity sold  at  the  national,  Census  division,  and  State  levels by  sector  and  class  of  utility  ownership.

"Average Revenue per Kilowatthour at the Electric Utility Level
Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  of  electricity  sold for each utility is calculated by dividing revenue from sales  to  ultimate  consumers  of  the  electric  utility  by the  corresponding  electricity  sales  to  all  sectors  by that  utility.  Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  is  a function     of     consumer     base,     ownership     class, geographic  location,  cost  of  fuel,  financing  arrange- ments, and other factors.
The   average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   varies   by sector;  accordingly,  differences  between  utilities  may represent  differences  in  the  proportion  of  sales  to  dif- ferent sectors. Average revenue per kilowatthour for a given   utility   does   not   reflect   differences   that   may exist in its revenue structure across sectors.
Average   revenue   per   kilowatthour   to   ultimate   con- sumers for Federally owned utilities tends to be lower than  for  the  other  ownership  classes.  Among  several factors contributing to this is that Federal electric util- ities   are   primarily   wholesale   power   producers   and serve  few,  if  any,  residential  consumers.  They  also have   access   to   relatively   inexpensive   hydropower. Publicly  owned  and  cooperative  utilities  share  some advantages  that  can  result  in  lower  average  revenue per  kilowatthour  than  investor-owned  utilities:  they are  nonprofit,  have  access  to  low-cost  financing,  and have   preference   for   purchasing   Federal   wholesale power.  However,  cooperatives  generally  have  broad service areas and a high percentage of residential con- sumers because of the nature of the rural communities that  they  traditionally  serve.  Municipal  utilities  have more   consolidated   service   areas   and   likely   have   a broader  base  of  industrial  and  commercial  consumers that  cooperatives.  The  result  is  that  cooperatives  have a  higher  cost  of  service  than  municipal  utilities  and  a corresponding       higher       average       revenue       per kilowatthour.  Investor-owned  utilities  must  produce  a rate-of-return  for  their  investors  and  generally  have diverse   consumer   bases   and   utilize   various   fuels. Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  individual  utili- ties   usually   ranges   between   4   and   12   cents   per kilowatthour.
In  Alaska,  average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  reflects the  high  costs  of  service  associated  with  generation and  distribution  in  that  State.  Utilities  in  Alaska  typi- cally  consist  of  isolated  systems,  which  lack  an  inte-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"grated   transmission   system   and   the   advantages   of economy of scale. Of the 80 reporting electric utilities in   Alaska,   79   utilities   have   average   revenue   per kilowatthour  exceeding  the  U.S.  average.  The  Power Cost   Equalization   (PCE)   subsidy   by   the   State   of Alaska was designed to compensate consumers served by  electric  utilities  located  in  rural  areas  where  trans- mission   access   is   limited   and   electric   power   is produced   with   expensive   diesel   gas   turbines.   The subsidy  is  allocated  to  electric  utilities  based  on  con- sumer   sector   and   demand   for   electricity   in   each sector.   Electric   utilities   that   qualify   for   the   PCE program  are  required  to  notify  consumers  of  the  cost of  electric  service  and  the  cost  minus  the  State  equal- ization.  Consumers  receiving  the  subsidy  do  not  actu- ally pay the high rates. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted   from   the   total   revenue   of   those   electric utilities  receiving  compensation  for  high  energy  costs in Tables 14 through 17 in this publication.
Electric  utilities  operating  on  islands  with  high  sea- sonal   populations   also   tend   to   have   high   average revenue  per  kilowatthour.  High  demand  charges  are needed  to  recover  the  fixed  equipment  and  operating costs  associated  with  generating  electricity  at  infre- quent  times.  These  circumstances  pertain  to  only  a few  utilities,  located  primarily  on  the  East  Coast  and in the Great Lakes area.
Tables  14,  15,  16,  and  17  present  the  number  of  ulti- mate  consumers,  retail  sales,  associated  revenue,  and average revenue per kilowatthour by State and electric utility  for  the  residential,  commercial,  industrial,  and all  sectors,  respectively.  When  an  electric  utility  pro- vided  service  to  ultimate  consumers  in  more  than  one State,  the  utility  is  listed  under  each  State  it  served. Table A1 in Appendix A lists the electric utilities that provided   service   in   more   than   one   State   and   the percent of sales in each State.
Electric  revenue  and  sales  data  are  reported  by  elec- tric    utilities    in    thousand    dollars    and    thousand kilowatthours.  Average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for electric   utilities   with   less   than   either   $100,000   of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours of sales is not pro- vided because the significance of these data is not suf- ficient  to  make  the  ratio  meaningful.  See  Appendix  C for   further   information.   Data   for   the   four   power authorities  of  American  Samoa,  Guam,  Puerto  Rico, and   the   Virgin   Islands   are   included   in   Tables   14 through 17.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

"1    The average revenue per kilowatthour of electricity sold is calculated by dividing revenue by sales.
2    Most electric utilities in the State of Alaska that have average revenue per kilowatthour exceeding the U.S. average compensate their rural consumers through the State of Alaska Power Cost Equalization (PCE) program. The PCE program was designed to offset the high generation and distribution costs that must otherwise be passed on to consumers in the form of high rates for electricity. The PCE subsidy has not been subtracted from the data shown in this table for the total revenue of those utilities receiving compensation for high energy costs.
3    The U.S. total excludes the four power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
4    Electric revenue and sales data are reported by electric utilities in thousand dollars and thousand kilowatthours. Average revenues per kilowatthour for electric utilities with either less than $100,000 of revenue or less than 1 million kilowatthours of sales are not provided because the significance of the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.
Notes: •Data are final. •The power authorities of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are not included in aggregated statistics unless specified. •Electric utilities serving consumers in more than one State are listed under each State served.

Electric Utilities Serving Ultimate Consumers in More Than One State",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Table  A1  lists  utilities  that  serve  ultimate  consumers in  more  than  one  State.  It  shows  the  States  served  by each  utility  and  the  percentage  of  sales  in  each  State. The  information  comes  from  Form  EIA-861,  “Annual Electric Utility Report.” The majority of electric utili- ties  that  serve  ultimate  consumers  in  more  than  one State  are  investor-owned  electric  utilities.  These  elec- tric   utilities   generally   have   large   franchise   service areas  and  historically  have  served  retail  consumers  in more  than  one  State.  Publicly  owned  electric  utilities usually  are  chartered  by  municipal  or  State  govern-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ments and provide service within the cities or counties where  they  are  located.  The  information  in  Table  A1 can  be  used  as  a  reference  to  Tables  14  through  17. For  example,  Table  A1  indicates  that  the  Appalachian Power   Company   serves   consumers   in   Virginia   and West    Virginia.    Tables    14    through    17    list    the Appalachian Power Company under both Virginia and West Virginia, showing the company's number of con- sumers,   sales,   revenue,   and   average   revenue   per kilowatthour in each State.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retail Power Marketing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Provisions  of  the  Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) authorized  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commis- sion  (FERC)  to  require  open  access  to  the  privately- owned    electric    transmission    systems    under    its jurisdiction   much   as   the   Federal   Communications Commission    and    telecommunications    deregulation expanded    customer    access    to    the    nation's    long- distance  communications  lines.  The  EPACT  allowed each  State  to  determine  the  level  of  retail  competition within   its   borders,   and,   for   the   first   time,   enabled organizations    not    previously    engaged    in    electric power  transactions,  to  purchase,  transmit  and  resell electric    power    across    traditional    electric    utility borders. Those organizations are usually referred to as power marketers.
Power marketers, like traditional electric utilities, buy and  sell  electric  power  in  the  wholesale  market.  But power  marketers  differ  from  traditional  electric  utili- ties  in  both  their  lack  of  ownership  interest  in  gener- ation,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  and  in the    geographic    sweep    of    their    transactions.    For instance,   in   1995   Electric   Clearinghouse,   Inc.   (a FERC  registered  power  marketer)  purchased  power  at off-peak   rates   from   the   California   Department   of Water  Resources  generated  during  the  early  morning hours,  scheduled  transmission  service  through  several major  systems  and  control  areas,  and  delivered  the power   across   the   country   to   the   Jacksonville   (FL) Electric  Authority.  Owing  to  the  three  hour  time-zone difference, Electric Clearinghouse was able to sell the power  at  on-peak  rates  in  Florida.  Electric  Clearing- house  neither  owned  nor  operated  any  of  the  gener- ation  and  transmission  facilities  used  in  completing the transaction.
Some  power  marketers  are  affiliated  with  companies owning  reserves  of  other  sources  of  energy,  such  as natural gas. An exchange of fuel for electricity known as  “tolling”  allows  a  power  marketer  with  access  to fuel  resources  to  “rent”  a  generator  from  an  electric utility,  supply  fuel  to  the  unit  to  produce  electricity, pay  the  “rental”  fee  with  a  portion  of  the  generated power,  and  take  delivery  of  the  balance  for  sale  to customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The   number   of   registered   power   marketers   with wholesale rates approved by the FERC has grown sub- stantially  in  the  past  few  years  from  11  in  1993  to approximately   400   in   1997   of   which   about   90   are affiliated  with  traditional  electric  utilities.  However, fewer than half of those registered with FERC in 1997 actually  conducted  wholesale  transactions.  Moreover, many  registered  power  marketers  undertook  few  pur- chases and sales wishing to simply test techniques and procedures,  and  observe  marketplace  opportunities.  In 1997,   power   marketers   purchased   and   sold   in   the wholesale  market  over  1  billion  megawatthours  -  an increase  over  1996  activities  of  almost  500  percent. Most power marketers make their impact by numerous small  transactions  with  sales  to  many  customers.  In fact,  many  power  marketer  transactions  are  with  other power  marketers.  Power  marketers  normally  do  not attempt to be an electric utility's all-requirements sup- plier.
Information  published  this  year  in  the  Electric  Sales and  Revenue   reflects   the   implementation   of   “retail wheeling”  pilot  programs  designed  by  the  State  legis- latures  and  regulatory  agencies  as  authorized  under the  EPACT.  In  1997,  several  States  reacted  to  pro- visions   in   EPACT   allowing   “retail   wheeling”   with States forming pilot programs where a limited number of  retail  electric  consumers  could  select  their  sup- pliers.  Power  marketers,  as  well  as  marketing  affil- iates  of  electric  utilities,  were  active  participants  in those programs.
Pilot   programs   were   underway   in   1997   in   several States       including       Illinois,       New       Hampshire, Washington,  Idaho,  and  Pennsylvania.  Sales  shown  in Table   B1   for   Energy   Services,   Inc   in   Oregon   and Idaho  are  the  customer's  point  of  delivery  (POD)  and do not reflect activity related to “retail wheeling” pro- grams  in  those  states.  In  each  case,  the  customer  is  a large  aluminum  smelter  located  in  Washington  State with  its  own  transmission  line  extending  across  State borders.  The  POD  is  the  customer's  interconnect  with its   previous   supplier's   (Bonneville   Power   Adminis- tration) transmission system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Data  reported  to  the  EIA  on  the  Form  EIA-861  by pilot  participants  should  be  viewed  in  the  context  of the  respective  pilot  program.  For  instance,  in  New Hampshire's   pilot   program   several   thousand   retail consumers    were    able    to    switch    suppliers.    New Hampshire   electric   consumers   participating   in   the pilot  program  who  chose  to  switch  power  suppliers, either  received  two  bills,  one  from  the  previous  sup- plier  and  one  from  the  current  power  supplier,  or, under   special   arrangement,   two   “service   provider” components  of  a  single  bill.

"Source of Data
The  Electric  Sales  and  Revenue  (ESR)  is  prepared  by the  Electric  Power  Division;  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear, Electric  and  Alternate  Fuels  (CNEAF);  Energy  Infor- mation   Administration   (EIA);   U.S.   Department   of Energy.  Data  published  in  the ESR  are  compiled  from the    EIA    statistical    survey    using    Form    EIA-861, “Annual  Electric  Utility  Report.”  A  brief  summary  of the form is presented below.
Form EIA-861
The  Form  EIA-861  is  a  mandatory  annual  census  of electric  utilities  in  the  United  States.  The  survey  is used   to   collect   information   on   power   production, sales,     and     demand-side-management     data     from approximately  3,200  electric  utilities.  The  collected data  are  used  to  maintain  and  update  EIA's  electric utility  frame  database.  This  database  enables  analysts to   respond   to   queries   from   the   Executive   Branch, Congress,   other   public   agencies,   and   the   general public.  Data  from  the  Form  EIA-861  also  appear  in other EIA publications: Electric Power Monthly, Elec- tric  Power  Annual,  Financial  Statistics  of  Major  U.S. Investor-Owned  Electric  Utilities,  Financial  Statistics of   Major   U.S.   Publicly   Owned   Electric   Utilities, Annual   Energy   Outlook,   and   U.S.   Electric   Utility Demand-Side   Management.    These    reports    present aggregate  totals  for  electric  utilities  at  the  national, regional, and/or State levels.
Instrument  and  Design  History.    Use  of  the  Form EIA-861 was begun in January 1985 to collect data as of  year-end  1984.  The  Federal  Energy  Administration Act  of  1974  (Public  Law  93-275)  defines  the  legisla- tive authority to collect these data.
Data  Processing.    The  Form  EIA-861  is  mailed  to the respondents at year end to collect data for the cal- endar year. The completed forms are to be returned to the  EIA  by  April  30.  The  data  are  entered  into  an interactive   on-line   system.   Internal   edit   checks   are performed to verify that current data total consistently across   and   between   schedules,   and   are   comparable with  data  reported  the  previous  year.  Edit  checks  are also  performed  to  compare  data  reported  on  the  Form EIA-861   with   similar   data   reported   on   the   Form
EIA-826, “Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"with   State   Distributions,""   Form   EIA-412,   ""Annual Report  of  Public  Electric  Utilities,”  and  the  Federal Energy   Regulatory   Commission   Form   1,   “Annual Report   of   Major   Electric   Utilities,   Licensees,   and Others.”  Respondents  are  contacted  by  telephone  to obtain   clarification   of   reported   data   or   to   obtain missing data.
The  Form  EIA-861  totals  shown  in  this  publication differ  somewhat  from  the  sum  of  the  monthly  Form EIA-826   data   for   sales   published   in   the   Electric Power  Monthly  and  in  issues  of  the  Electric  Power Annual  prior  to  1988.  Both  forms  use  sectorial  classi- fications    (residential,    commercial,    industrial,    and other)  based  on  the  classification  of  consumers  by  the electric  utilities.  At  the  national  level,  totals  from  the Form  EIA-861  and  Form  EIA-826  correspond  closely (within 1 percent) for all end-use sectors. Some larger differences  appear  at  the  State  level,  however,  partic- ularly  for  Tennessee,  due  to  an  inconsistency  between the  two  forms  in  the  classification  of  commerical  and and industial data.
Differences   between   the   Form   EIA-861   and   Form EIA-826 totals can also result from the Form EIA-826 sampling  procedure  and/or  from  nonsampling  error  in either   data   collection.   One   source   of   nonsampling error  in  the  Form  EIA-826  stems  from  the  practice  of filing  estimates  for  monthly  sales  and  revenue  when actual figures are not yet available. Although respond- ents   are   instructed   to   file   revisions,   they   do   not always  do  so.  The  respondents  are  also  instructed  to review  the  sum  of  their  EIA-826  monthly  data  at  the end  of  the  reporting  year  to  ensure  consistency  with Form EIA-861 annual data. Survey analysts at the EIA compare  these  data  series  and  attempt  to  resolve  any differences.  Nevertheless,  some  reporting  differences remain.
Electric   revenue   and   sales   data   are   rounded   and reported  by  electric  utilities  in  thousand  dollars  and thousand   kilowatthours.   For   this   publication,   the average  revenue  per  unit  of  electricity  sold  is  calcu- lated  by  dividing  electric  revenue  from  sales  to  ulti- mate    consumers    by    the    corresponding    sales    of electricity.  Tables  14  through  17  do  not  indicate  the average  revenue  per  kilowatthour  for  electric  utilities with less than either $100,000 of revenue or 1 million kilowatthours  of  sales  because  the  significance  of  the data is not sufficient to make the ratio meaningful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Quality of Data
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels    (CNEAF)    is    responsible    for    routine    data improvement   and   quality   assurance   activities.   All operations  in  this  office  are  performed  in  accordance with formal standards established by the EIA to define statistical  quality.  Data  improvement  efforts  include automated   verification   of   keyed   data,   editing   by subject   matter   specialists,   and   followup   on   nonre- spondents.  By  law,  nonrespondents  may  be  fined  or otherwise  penalized  for  not  filing  a  mandatory  EIA data  form.  Before  invoking  penalties,  the  EIA  tries  to obtain  the  required  information  by  encouraging  coop- eration of nonrespondents.

Rounding Rules for Data
Given a number with r digits to the left of the decimal and  d+t  digits  in  the  fraction  part,  with  d  being  the place  to  which  the  number  is  to  be  rounded  and  t being  the  remaining  digits  that  will  be  truncated,  this number  is  rounded  to  r+d  digits  by  adding  5  to  the (r+d+1)th digit when the number is positive or by sub- tracting  5  when  the  number  is  negative.  The  t  digits are  then  truncated  at  the  (r+d+1)th  digit.  The  symbol for a rounded number truncated to zero is (*).
Data Correction Procedure
The  Office  of  Coal,  Nuclear,  Electric  and  Alternate Fuels has adopted the following policy with respect to the   revision   and   correction   of   Form   EIA-861   data published in this report.
•    Publication    of    these    data    results    in    their finalization, at which point the database is closed.
•    Revisions   or   corrections   are   made   only   in   the event  that  a  substantial  (greater  than  1  percent) data  revision  is  received  or  a  substantial  (greater than 1 percent) error is discovered.
•    No revisions will be made without the approval of the Director, Electric Power Division.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Base  Bill:    A  charge  calculated  by  taking  the  rate from    the    appropriate    electric    rate    schedule    and applying it to the level of consumption.
Base Rate:   A fixed per-kilowatthour charge for elec- tricity  consumed  that  is  independent  of  other  charges and/or adjustments.
Block Rate Schedule:   An electric rate schedule with a   provision   for   charging   a   different   unit   cost   for various   increasing   blocks   of   demand   or   energy. Usually   a   reduced   price   is   charged   on   succeeding blocks.
Census  Divisions:    The  nine  geographic  divisions  of the  United  States  established  by  the  Bureau  of  the Census,  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  for  statistical analysis.  The  boundaries  of  Census  divisions  coincide with  State  boundaries.  The  Pacific  Division  is  subdi- vided into the Pacific Contiguous and Pacific Noncon- tiguous areas.
Classes  of  Service:    Groups  of  consumers  identified on  the  basis  of  shared  characteristics  for  the  purpose of  setting  common  rates  for  electric  service.  These groups  are  usually  residential,  commercial,  industrial and other.
Class   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate   schedule applicable to one or more specified classes of service, groups of businesses, or customer uses.
Commercial  Sector:    The  commercial  sector  is  gen- erally   defined   as   nonmanufacturing   business   estab- lishments,    including    hotels,    motels,    restaurants, wholesale  businesses,  retail  stores,  and  health,  social, and   educational   institutions.   Electric   utilities   may classify  commercial  service  as  service  that  includes all  consumers  whose  demand  or  annual  use  exceeds some  specified  limit.  The  limit  may  be  set  by  the utility  based  on  the  rate  schedule  of  the  utility.  If certain  consumers  (e.g.,  farms  or  irrigation  projects) cannot   be   identified   as   residential,   commercial,   or industrial,  they  should  be  classified  with  the  group they   most   closely   resemble.   If   there   is   no   rate schedule  distinction,  utilities  may  define  commercial consumers   as   those   having   a   demand   of   less   than 1,000 kilowatts.
Consumer  Charge:    An  amount  charged  periodically to  a  consumer  for  such  utility  costs  as  billing  and meter  reading,  without  regard  to  demand  or  energy consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooperative   Electric   Utility:     A   group   organized under  the  law  into  a  utility  company  that  will  gen- erate,  transmit,  and/or  distribute  supplies  of  electric energy   to   a   specified   area   not   being   serviced   by another  utility.  Such  ventures  are  generally  exempt from the Federal income tax laws. Most electric coop- eratives   have   initially   been   financed   by   the   Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Cost  of  Service:    A  ratemaking  concept  used  for  the design  and  development  of  rate  schedules  to  ensure that  the  filed  rate  schedules  recover  only  the  cost  of providing  the  electric  service  at  issue.  These  costs include  operating  and  maintenance  expenses,  depreci- ation   and   amortization   expenses,   and   income   and other  taxes  that  the  regulatory  agency  finds  just  and reasonable    to    include    in    costs    considered    for ratemaking.  In  addition,  privately  owned  utilities  may include  in  the  cost  of  service  an  allowance  for  return on  capital  (usually  computed  by  applying  a  rate  of return  to  the  rate  base).  This  concept  represents  an effort  to  equate  the  costs  incurred  by  the  utility  with the  revenue  received  for  the  service  provided  to  each of the consumer classes.
Demand   (Electric):     The   rate   at   which   electric energy   is   delivered   to   or   by   a   system,   part   of   a system,  or  piece  of  equipment,  at  a  given  instant  or averaged over any designated period of time.
Demand  Charge:    The  portion  of  the  consumer's  bill for  electric  service  that  is  based  on  the  consumer's maximum electric capacity usage.
Economy  of  Scale:    The  principle  that  larger  pro- duction  facilities  have  lower  unit  costs  than  smaller facilities.
Electric  Power  Industry:    The  privately,  publicly, federally,  and  cooperatively  owned  electric  utilities and nonutilities of the United States taken as a whole. Includes  all  electric  systems  serving  the  public:  regu- lated    investor-owned    electric    utility    companies; Federal  power  projects;  State,  municipal,  and  other government-owned  systems,  including  electric  public utility districts; electric cooperatives, including gener- ation and transmission entities; and nonutilites.
Electric  Rate:    The  price  set  for  a  specified  amount of  electricity  in  an  electric  rate  schedule  or  sales  con- tract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Electric  Rate  Schedule:    A  statement  of  the  electric rate  and  the  terms  and  conditions  governing  its  appli- cation,  including  attendant  contract  terms  and  condi- tions  that  have  been  accepted  by  a  regulatory  body with appropriate oversight authority.
Electric  Utility:    An  enterprise  that  is  engaged  in  the generation,   transmission,   or   distribution   of   electric energy  primarily  for  use  by  the  public  and  that  is  the major power supplier within a designated service area. Electric   utilities   include   privately   owned,   publicly owned,  cooperatively  owned,  and  government-owned (municipals,   Federal   agencies,   State   projects,   and public power districts) systems.
Energy:   The capacity for doing work as measured by the  capability  of  doing  work  (potential  energy)  or  the conversion    of    this    capability    to    motion    (kinetic energy).  Energy  has  several  forms,  some  of  which  are easily convertible and can be changed to another form useful   for   work.   Most   of   the   world's   convertible energy   comes   from   fossil   fuels   that   are   burned   to produce heat that is then used as a transfer medium to mechanical   or   other   means   in   order   to   accomplish tasks.    Electrical    energy    is    usually    measured    in kilowatthours,  while  heat  energy  is  usually  measured in British thermal units.
Energy   Information   Administration   (EIA):     An independent   agency   within   the   U.S.   Department   of Energy  that  develops  surveys,  collects  energy  data, and  produces  analyses  of  energy  issues  and  models  to project    future    developments.    The    agency    must respond   to   requests   of   Congress,   other   elements within   the   Department   of   Energy,   Federal   Energy Regulatory  Commission,  the  Executive  Branch,  and its own independent needs, and must assist the general public   and   other   interest   groups   without   taking   a policy position.
Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC): A   quasi-independent   regulatory   agency   within   the Department  of  Energy  having  jurisdiction  over  inter- state  electricity  sales,  wholesale  electric  rates,  hydro- electric   licensing,   natural   gas   pricing,   oil   pipeline rates, and gas pipeline certification.
Flat   and   Meter   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  consisting  of  two  components,  the  first  of which  is  a  service  charge,  and  the  second,  a  price  for the energy consumed.
Flat   Demand   Rate   Schedule:     An   electric   rate schedule  based  on  billing  demand  that  provides  no charge for energy.
Gigawatt (GW):   One billion watts.
Gigawatthour (GWh):   One billion watthours.
Industrial  Sector:    The  industrial  sector  is  generally defined    as    including    manufacturing,    construction, mining,   agriculture,   fishing,   and   forestry   establish- ments  under  Standard  Industrial  Classification  (SIC) codes  01  through  39.  The  utility  may  classify  indus- trial  service  using  the  SIC  codes,  or  based  on  demand or  annual  usage  exceeding  some  specified  limit.  The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"limit  may  be  set  by  the  utility  based  on  its  own  rate schedule.   Sales   to   consumers   (i.e.,   farms   and   irri- gation)  that  the  utility  has  no  system  for  separating into  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial  classifica- tions  should  be  classified  based  on  the  schedule  they most closely resemble. If there is no rate schedule dis- tinction,  utilities  may  define  industrial  consumers  as those  having  a  demand  equal  to  or  greater  than  1,000 kilowatts.
Interdepartmental  Sales:    Includes  amounts  charged by  the  electric  department  at  tariff  or  other  specified rates   for   electricity   supplied   by   it   to   other   utility departments.
Investor-Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that  is  investor-owned  and  organized  as  a  tax-paying business, usually financed by the sales of securities in the capital market.
Kilowatt (kW):   One thousand watts.
Kilowatthour (kWh):   One thousand watthours.
Megawatt (MW):   One million watts.
Megawatthour (MWh):   One million watthours.
Other  Sector:    Electricity  supplied  to  public  street and  highway  lighting,  other  service  to  public  authori- ties,  service  to  railroads  and  and  railways,  and  inter- departmental service.
Power  (Electrical):    An  electric  unit  of  power  called a  voltampere  is  equal  to  the  product  of  1  volt  and  1 ampere.   This   is   equivalent   to   1   watt   for   a   direct current  system,  and  a  unit  of  apparent  power  is  sepa- rated  into  real  and  reactive  power.  Real  power  is  the work-producing  part  of  apparent  power  that  measures the  rate  of  supply  of  energy  and  is  denoted  as  kilo- watts  (kW).  Reactive  power  is  the  portion  of  apparent power that does no work and is referred to as kilovars; this  type  of  power  must  be  supplied  to  most  types  of magnetic  equipment,  such  as  motors,  and  is  supplied by     generator     or     by     electrostatic     equipment. Voltamperes  are  usually  divided  by  1,000  and  called kilovoltamperes   (kVA).   Energy   is   denoted   by   the product  of  real  power  and  the  length  of  time  utilized; this product is expressed as kilowatthours.
Power   Marketers:     Business   entities   engaged   in buying,   selling,   and   marketing   electricity.   Power marketers  do  not  ususally  own  generating  or  trans- mission   facilities.   Power   marketers,   as   opposed   to Power  Brokers,  take  ownership  of  the  electricity  and are  involved  in  interstate  trade.  These  entities  must file  with  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission for approval of rate tariffs.
Public  Authorities:    Electricity  supplied  to  munici- palities  or  divisions  or  agencies  of  State  and  Federal governments, usually under special contracts or agree- ments that are applicable only to public authorities.
Public Street and Highway Lighting Service:   Elec- tricity  supplied  and  services  rendered  for  the  purpose of  lighting  streets,  highways,  parks,  and  other  public",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Publicly  Owned  Electric  Utility:    A  class  of  utility that   includes   those   utilities   operated   by   munici- palities,  political  subdivisions,  utility  or  power  dis- tricts, and State and Federal power agencies.
Railroad  and  Railway  Electric  Service:    Electricity supplied  to  railroads  and  interurban  and  street  rail- ways,  for  general  railroad  use,  including  the  propul- sion  of  cars  or  locomotives,  where  such  electricity  is supplied under separate and distinct rate schedules.
Rate   Base:     The   value   of   property   upon   which   a utility is permitted to earn a specified rate of return as established  by  a  regulatory  authority.  The  rate  base generally  represents  the  value  of  property  used  by  the utility  in  providing  service  and  may  be  calculated  by any  one  or  a  combination  of  the  following  accounting methods:  fair  value,  prudent  investment,  reproduction cost,  or  original  cost.  Depending  on  which  method  is used,  the  rate  base  includes  cash,  working  capital, materials  and  supplies,  and  deductions  for  accumu- lated  provisions  for  depreciation,  contributions  in  aid of  construction,  customer  advances  for  construction, accumulated  deferred  income  taxes,  and  accumulated deferred investment tax credits.
Residential  Sector:    The  residential  sector  includes private   homes,   including   apartment   buildings,   that consume   energy   primarily   for   space   heating,   water heating,    air    conditioning,    lighting,    refrigeration, cooking,  and  clothes  drying.  The  classification  of  an individual  consumer's  account,  where  the  use  is  both residential and commercial, is based on principal use.
